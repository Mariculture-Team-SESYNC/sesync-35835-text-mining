WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 -- Peter O. Thomas, executive director of the Marine Mammal Commission, Bethesda, Maryland, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written on Dec. 22, 2020, and posted on Dec. 23, 2020:
* * *
The Marine Mammal Commission (the Commission) has been closely following the implementation of the 7 May 2020 Executive Order on "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth."/1
In consultation with its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, the Commission has reviewed the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) 23 October 2020 request for information on the current and future plans for Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) in the Gulf of Mexico, Southern California, and nationwide. As a general matter, the Commission is concerned that longline, cage, and other aquaculture gear associated with algae, shellfish, finfish, and combination aquaculture facilities may have impacts on cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians, given uncertainties on whether and how marine mammals respond to or avoid man-made structures in the water. In particular, the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and Gulf of Mexico Bryde's Whale (Balaenoptera edeni GOM subspecies) could be severely affected by even a few deaths. The Commission offers the following comments and recommendations in response to NMFS's question (#3 in the FRN) regarding the overlap of aquaculture gear with areas important to protected species.
Marine Mammals and Aquaculture Interactions
Marine mammals may interact with or be impacted by aquaculture gear, facilities, and activities in a number of ways, including entanglement and other gear interactions, habitat exclusion and modification, noise disturbance, and vessel strikes (e.g., Wursig et al. 2002, Becker et al. 2011, MMC 2011, Clement 2013, Price et al. 2016, Callier et al. 2017, NMFS 2019, Barrett et al. 2019). A number of attributes of marine aquaculture infrastructure could increase the threat of entanglement and non-lethal injury, including the arrangement of anchor lines, horizontal support longlines, vertical mussel grow lines, and marker buoy lines. The spat collection and surface buoy lines may pose the greatest risk (Moore & Wieting 1999, Lloyd 2003, Keeley et al. 2009, Clement 2013).
Large whales (baleen whales and sperm whales) are known to become entangled in nets or ropes associated with fishing activities. Entanglements can result in death or sublethal injuries or impairments that affect health and reproduction. Many aquaculture facilities use nets and most, if not all, use ropes to tether the facility to anchors or buoys, interconnect arrays of cages or longlines, and suspend algae or shellfish in the water column. These lines pose an entanglement threat to large whales. In addition, if the netting used for finfish cages is not kept taut, cetaceans or pinnipeds can become entangled. Instances of whales becoming entangled in aquaculture gear have been reported around the world (Kemper & Gibbs 2001, Noke & O'Dell 2003, Allen & Bejder 2003, Kemper et al. 2003, Coughran 2005, Kemper et al. 2008).
Finfish facilities and their cages are often attractive to pinnipeds and small cetaceans that attempt to depredate fish from the cages (Guclusoy & Savas 2003, Quick et al. 2004, Diaz Lopez & Bernal-Shirai 2007, Sepulveda et al. 2015, Callier et al. 2017). These interactions can result in entanglement in cage netting, entrapment within cages, injuries suffered while trying to get into the cages, or harassment by facility employees seeking to deter depredation./2
Aquaculture facilities can displace marine mammals from important habitat used for feeding, reproduction, calving, or migration (Olesiuk et al. 2002, Johnston 2002 Markowitz et al. 2004, Pearson et al. 2009, Diaz Lopez & Methion 2017). In addition, vessel activities associated with the operation of aquaculture facilities create the potential for acoustic disturbance and vessel strikes. Although there is little evidence to date that this threat is problem, it warrants monitoring and management to ensure minimal levels.
Harmful algal blooms are known or suspected causes of marine mammal deaths (e.g., Van Dolah et al. 2003, Flewelling et al. 2005, Torres de la Riva et al. 2009, Haussermann et al. 2017, Broadwater et al. 2018). Because nutrients from feces and excess feed can stimulate the growth of harmful algal blooms, finfish aquaculture operations have the potential to pose a significant threat to marine mammals (Ross Brown et al. 2019).
Vulnerable Species and Habitats
NMFS is in the midst of its programmatic evaluation of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas for shellfish, finfish, algae, or a combination of these methods in the Gulf of Mexico, Southern California, and future areas across the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In these early stages of the programmatic planning process, the Commission offers the following comments on the range, distribution, and vulnerability of sensitive species in federal waters nationwide./3
The Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale (Rosel et al. 2016), as with other large whales, is known to be vulnerable to fatal entanglement in, and non-lethal interactions with, active and derelict fishing gear. Aquaculture facilities would add to the current threats to Bryde's whales and their habitat, which include pelagic and longline fisheries, vessel strikes, and ocean noise associated with energy development. Bryde's whale interactions with mussel aquaculture have been documented in New Zealand and Australia (Wursig & Gailey 2002, Lloyd 2003, Groom & Coughran 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, habitat vital to the survival and recovery of the Bryde's whale population may be affected by the proposed aquaculture projects.
Anchoring, stabilizing, and buoy lines that are part of aquaculture facilities pose an entanglement risk, which needs to be mitigated through careful site selection and facility design. In considering AOAs in the Gulf of Mexico, the Commission recommends that NOAA ensure that AOAs do not overlap with the habitat of Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whales (Soldevilla et al. 2017), and as a precautionary measure since use of habitats can change over time, implement gear modification, monitoring, and siting practices that prevent, or at least mitigate, the risk of entanglement to these whales.
No information is available on the potential effects of aquaculture on Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus). However, this should be considered for future projects within the near-shore habitat occupied by these animals in the Gulf of Mexico (Wursig & Gailey 2002).
As in the Gulf of Mexico, longline or finfish aquaculture facilities sited in Southern California will create entanglement risk to large whales. Several endangered populations of large whales occur in those waters, including blue (Balaenoptera musculus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae; 'Mexico DPS' and 'Central America DPS') and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) that forage in, and migrate through, the region. In addition, many gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) migrate through the region twice yearly. The Commission recommends that NMFS, in assessing the suitability of potential AOAs in Southern California, place emphasis on delineating the foraging areas and migratory corridors of these species. Further, as with the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale population discussed above, the Commission recommends that NMFS ensure that aquaculture facilities are sited to avoid overlap with foraging areas and migratory corridors of large whales and are designed to minimize the likelihood of entanglements of large whales.
In addition, a number of species of pinnipeds and small cetaceans occur, and some breed, in Southern California, creating the potential for entanglement and for depredation of finfish aquaculture cages. The Commission recommends that NMFS, in assessing the suitability of sites for AOAs in Southern California, identify pinniped rookeries and the core habitat of small cetaceans, take these into account in siting decisions, and ensure that all facilities are constructed and operated in a manner that will minimize the opportunities for entanglement and depredation by pinnipeds and small cetaceans.
AOAs sited in the future in other areas of the EEZ could come into conflict with other populations of marine mammals, including ones listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As in the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California, NMFS, in evaluating regions for the placement of AOAs, should carefully consider the potential impact on vulnerable marine mammals that use those regions for feeding, breeding, calving and migration.
The Commission draws particular attention to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, which calves in the southeastern United States, mainly off South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida. The whales forage in New England and southeastern Canadian waters, and undertakes a north-south migration each year. Right whales are rapidly declining largely due to entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. Any injuries or deaths due to human activities will accelerate the species' decline toward extinction. Therefore, the Commission strongly recommends that for the foreseeable future no aquaculture facilities be sited off the east coast in areas within the known distribution of North Atlantic right whales. NMFS's efforts to reduce the number of vertical lines in the water column associated with fishing activities would be somewhat undermined if it then allows lines associated with aquaculture facilities.
A similar, but less dire, situation exists off the west coast from Point Conception, California, to the Canadian border, where in recent years large and possibly unsustainable numbers of humpback and blue whales have died from entanglement in crab pot lines. The Commission recommends that NMFS take a precautionary approach in assessing the suitability of sites for AOAs on the west coast, given the potential for exacerbating the current entanglement problem affecting the survival of endangered large whales there.
There is currently a NOAA-led and Navy-supported initiative to delineate and score a second round of Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans, focusing on but not limited to, the US EEZ and state waters. BIAs are areas where cetacean species and populations are known to concentrate for feeding, breeding, and migratory purposes, and where small and resident populations occur. The Marine Mammal Commission recommends that the NOAA aquaculture program monitor the progress of the BIA delineations and use the BIAs when assessing the suitability of potential AOAs.
Management Options
Since data on open-ocean aquaculture are limited, the Commission recommends the following non-exhaustive management options for fishing gear that are relevant to aquaculture. The anchor and buoy lines associated with fixed fishing gear pose a major risk to endangered and protected species. These lines are similar to those used in the designs of some marine aquaculture farms. Offshore farms tend to use thick metal cables under high tension or high tensile-strength lines (Ogmundarson et al. 2011). While thick, tense lines are less likely to pose an entanglement risk to small cetaceans, collisions by the animals with such lines could result in non-fatal injuries (Baldwin et al. 2012). High-tension lines could also pose entanglement and injury risks to large whales. By limiting loose, unattended lines, or unnecessary lines, offshore aquaculture farms could limit the risk of entanglement or collision.
One additional mitigation option would be to apply data-informed spatial planning that seeks to avoid overlap between aquaculture facilities and the animals' home ranges, foraging and breeding areas, and migration routes. Aquaculture planning requires quantifying and minimizing the ecosystem footprint of siting, construction, and operation. Appropriate siting and geospatial analyses can limit the impacts of aquaculture. However, there is concern that farms may impede access to foraging or influence movements and habitat use. Spatial or temporal adjustments could reduce the effective overlap of aquaculture operations with the distribution of species of concern (Lindell & Bailey 2015).
Post-siting monitoring is vital to assessing the effectiveness of strategies to reduce the risk of harmful interactions between protected species and marine aquaculture. Quantification of observer program data and cooperative field observation and experimentation have been used in Maine's lobster fisheries. This approach could be instructive for monitoring aquaculture interactions (Soykan et al. 2008, McCarron & Tetreault 2012). Limiting the presence of lines and other entanglement risks is vital to preventing harmful marine-mammal and aquaculture interactions. Gear modifications such as those used to reduce rope strength along the U.S. East Coast and Canada could be instructive for marine aquaculture projects (Knowlton 2015). The Commission recommends that the mitigation measures described above be implemented in tandem with an adaptive management and monitoring approach.
Statutory Authority
Executive Order 13921 designates NOAA as the "lead agency" for aquaculture located in the Exclusive Economic Zone and assigns that agency the primary role in "navigating proposed projects through the Federal environmental review and authorization process." It is unclear whether these decisions were premised on a determination or an assumption that NMFS already has management and regulatory authority over aquaculture activities by virtue of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or simply that the agency has had a role and taken an interest in such matters in the past. If the former is the case, we note that a recent Fifth Circuit Court decision, although perhaps limited in geographic scope, throws such determination or assumption into question. The court ruled that Congress did not confer regulatory authority for aquaculture operations to NMFS under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Given this uncertainty, the Commission recommends that NOAA, as part of its implementation of the Executive Order, clarify the steps that make up the "Federal environmental review and authorization process" for aquaculture activities, explain whether the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act are relevant to some or all of these activities, and, if not, describe any other laws and mechanisms it will use to ensure that aquaculture operations are situated and operated in ways that minimize risks to marine mammals and other resources.
Conclusions
Many of the potential effects of aquaculture on marine mammals described in this letter are difficult to evaluate because of insufficient data on the interactions between marine mammals and aquaculture. To address the need for adequate scientific information, the Commission recommends that NOAA include in its aquaculture policy a clear description of the existing gaps in the scientific information needed to manage aquaculture with respect to impacts on protected species, the research required to close those gaps, and the funding required to support the research. With regard to marine mammals, the following are examples of topics that warrant further research: (1) facility design and construction standards to minimize damage to and from marine mammals; (2) effects (and mitigation) of facility siting, design, and operation on marine mammal behavior, movements, and health; (3) effects (and mitigation) of facility operations and byproducts on marine ecosystems; (4) impacts on the forage base of marine mammals as forage fish are harvested for aquaculture feed and measures to alleviate those impacts; and (5) effects of the accidental escape of cultivated species.
Some of the most important information to be collected pertains to the nature, frequency, and significance of aquaculture/marine mammal interactions. Over time, the most effective means of evaluating such interactions and identifying possible unforeseen effects is requiring aquaculture operators to monitor and report.
The Commission appreciates the opportunity to submit recommendations during the planning process for current and future AOAs. Thank you for considering the Commission's comments as your agency develops national offshore aquaculture policy. Please do not hesitate to be in contact if you have questions about the Commission's recommendations or comments.
Sincerely,
Peter O. Thomas, Ph.D.,

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 -- Katy White, fisheries biologist at WSP USA Inc., Portland, Oregon, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice and request for information entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written and posted on Dec. 22, 2020:
* * *
WSP USA, Inc. (WSP) is honored to respond to the Request for Information to identify Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) in Southern California (SoCal), the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), and other U.S. waters.
In crafting this response, WSP has chosen to identify factors relevant to identify AOAs and conduct preliminary Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling to determine potential AOAs in both SoCal waters and in the GoM. WSP's intent in submitting this response is to demonstrate to NOAA the type of analysis we believe would be beneficial in determining potential AOAs.
This preliminary modeling and determination of suitable AOAs is based on WSP's similar experience in conducting ocean planning for government clients related to offshore leasing for wind, solar, marine hydrokinetic, and telecommunications cable, as well as our experience with aquaculture, fisheries, and associated resources and industries.
In the results section, we present preliminary maps of areas that we believe are suitable for AOAs; these areas would be refined through additional data and analyses.
Best regards,
Katy White

1.0: Pilot Study using Preliminary GIS for Question One
Multiple abiotic, social, and cultural resource factors influence the potential for an area to sustain multi-species aquaculture. Several modeling approaches have been developed to identify suitable areas worldwide ranging in complexity and combining allometric relationships and remote sensing techniques (see Gentry et al. 2017 for a review). However, most approaches consider one or more of the following: hydrodynamic characteristics, temperature, depth, distance from shore, water quality (e.g., dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, etc.), and cultural considerations such as military presence, essential fish habitat, and fishery zones. To begin to consider suitable areas for aquaculture operations in U.S. waters and to demonstrate our approach, WSP has developed a preliminary GIS Model to site potential areas in Southern California (SoCal) and the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) using an initial assessment of five factors (Table 1).
See table here (https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=NOAA-NMFS-2020-0118-0053&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf)
Table 1. The five biotic and spatial use conflicts used to assess AOAs in SoCal and the GoM.
1.1 Technical Approach
The rationale and parameters considered for each of these factors are described below.
1.1.1 Depth
Water depth is a vital parameter when siting AOAs, particularly with regards to finfish, because it will assist in dilution of excess nutrients and waste from the aquaculture farms. A greater depth allows for nutrient and waste dispersal as the particles sink and are exposed to currents (Borja et al. 2009). This prevents nutrient aggregation in sediments that is often seen in nearshore aquaculture and can lead to hypoxic conditions.
1.1.2 Temperature
Temperature considerations are essential for aquaculture siting for two main reasons. Primarily, the temperature gradient must be within the range of tolerance for an individual species to be farmed. Secondarily, cooler waters hold more oxygen and are less susceptible to anoxic conditions. Table 2 details the common aquaculture species considered, the temperature ranges they can survive in, and the regions where they are found. Table 3 below details the temperature envelopes used in our preliminary GIS Model to determine what areas common aquaculture species can survive in within SoCal and the GoM.
Table 2. Common aquaculture species, scientific names, groups, temperature ranges, and regions suitable for production (adapted from Cai et al. 2019a; Cai et al. 2019b; Carpenter, K. 2002; Aquarium of the Pacific 2020; Fernandez et al. 2020; McHugh, D.J. 2003).
Table 3. The temperature envelopes used in the preliminary GIS Model for SoCal and the GoM. Table indicates the temperature envelope for SoCal allows 14 species, and the temperature envelope for the GoM allows 10 species.
1.1.3 Chlorophyll-a
Chlorophyll-a concentration is important both as an indicator of water quality and food availability. Water quality affects the productivity of aquatic organisms (Harris et al. 1999; Page & Hubbard 1987) and can be assessed remotely using a variety of related parameters. Chlorophyll-a concentration is among the parameters most often used to assess water quality and is strongly related to other water quality parameters such as nutrient concentration and dissolved organic matter (Gholizadeh et al. 2016). Chlorophyll-a can also be used as an indicator of bivalve food availability (Gentry et al. 2017) for self-sustaining operations or to balance local and operational conditions using an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture approach (Price & Morris 2013). These data are also widely available with various improvements in remote sensing techniques developed for inland and coastal applications (Clark et al. 1997; Egerton et al 2014; Gholizadeh et al. 2016; Ma et al. 2014). For our preliminary GIS Model, chlorophyll-a was set at a maximum of 20 mg/m3 (Table 4) to account for seasonal variability and to exclude areas with excessively poor water quality (e.g., gulf dead zones; Rabalais et al. 2004).
1.1.4 Distance from Shore
Nearshore areas are typically high in pollution, marine traffic, and low in water flow (Gentry et al. 2016). Siting aquaculture areas further from shore could reduce parasite loads and mortality while enhancing fish conditions (Kirchoff et al. 2011). For our preliminary GIS Model we assessed a minimum distance from shore for SoCal, as stated in the RFI, detailed in Table 4. The depth range of 50-150m for the GoM is sufficient to ensure distance from shore was quantified. Distance from shore is an important siting variable when considering the logistics and overall cost of the construction and operation of an aquaculture facility.
1.1.5 Spatial Use Conflicts
Spatial use conflicts and restrictions are vital when siting a marine use area. Military, fishing zones, essential fish habitats, marine protected areas, and high marine transit routes are considered spatial use conflicts. For our preliminary GIS Model for SoCal and the GoM, the spatial use conflict layer incorporated was marine protected areas. A full evaluation of spatial use conflicts would include all of the factors listed above but has been omitted from this response based on time constraints. Some marine protected areas could allow aquaculture facilities within their areas, for our preliminary GIS Model we included all marine protected areas as an exclusion of potential AOA sites.
1.1.6 Model Methodology
A spatial analysis was conducted using ESRI ArcGIS 10.7 Spatial Analyst Extension and Model Builder tool. The SoCal Model extent was defined as areas of the Pacific Ocean that are within the U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ), within 25 nautical miles of the SoCal coastline (including the Channel Islands), and south of Point Conception. The GoM Model extent was defined as all areas of the GoM that are within the U.S. EEZ. Derived monthly average 5x5 kilometer grids of MODIS Sea Surface Temperature and MODIS Chlorophyll-a Concentration for each month in 2019 were obtained from the NASA Earth Observation Data Portal (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Ocean Ecology Laboratory, Ocean Biology Processing Group 2014), and detailed in Table 4 below. Monthly average grids were used to calculate the minimum and maximum sea surface temperature (- Celsius) and maximum chlorophyll-a (mg/m3) for each 5x5 grid cell. Bathymetric 5x5 grids were resampled from ETOP01 Global Relief Model 2x2 km grids (NOAA National Geophysical Center 2009). marine protected area vector data were obtained and converted to a 5x5 km raster grid (NOAA 2017).
All parameter grids were multiplied together using the ESRI ArcGIS 10.7 Spatial Analyst Extension Raster Calculator tool resulting in two model result grids (one for each study area) showing suitable and unsuitable areas for multi-species aquaculture. This analysis was conducted to establish a preliminary model framework that tests the validity of our spatial analysis methods. A product of this exercise is an ArcGIS Model Builder tool that can be used to automate multiple variations of covariates, parameter assignments, and model extents.
* This range is intentionally generous and is meant to accommodate a maximum potential number of aquaculture organisms.
Yen This value represents a cutoff of allowable maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations and is meant to balance eutrophication concerns (e.g., Egerton et al. 2014) and allow for self-sustaining bivalve operations (e.g., Price & Morris 2013).
Table 4. Parameters used in the GIS Model for SoCal and the GoM.
1.2 Results
1.2.1 Identifying AOAs
Several considerations will drive the siting of suitable AOAs (Gentry et al. 2016; Price & Morris 2013). Here, we reached a balance between available geospatial data and general species requirements to provide a high-level assessment of the general AOAs in SoCal and the GoM regions. To do so, we first limited space within each region following region-specific depth and distance requirements specified in the RFI (Table 4). Two region-specific temperature envelopes were then developed to identify areas suitable for the growth of several commonly farmed organisms (Table 3). We then further limited space to exclude areas where maximum monthly chlorophyll-a concentration exceeded 20 mg/m3. This constraint was designed to avoid areas with poor water quality driven, in part, by excessive nutrient pollution (e.g., dead zones in GoM). Finally, areas meeting previous constraints but falling within marine protected areas were excluded. The remaining areas represent a high-level identification of potential sites for AOAs in SoCal and the GoM (colored green in Figures 1 and 2).
Figure 1. Preliminary GIS Model results of suitable and unsuitable AOAs in SoCal.
The results of our preliminary GIS Model for SoCal show 0.76% (239 km2) of the offshore area between Point Conception and San Diego is suitable for aquaculture based on our initially identified parameters (Figure 1 and Table 5). The suitable area is concentrated in five small blocks north and south of the western Channel Islands. The most limiting parameter suitable for aquaculture in SoCal is the maximum sea surface temperature. An area encompassing 76.78% (26,097 km2 out of 33,991 km2) of the model extent is outside the acceptable maximum sea surface temperature range (Table 5). The least limiting parameter suitable for aquaculture is the minimum sea surface temperature. An area encompassing 0.00% (0 km2 out of 34,007 km2) of the model extent is outside the acceptable maximum sea surface temperature range (Table 5).
Table 5. Total km2 for each parameter to determine suitable and unsuitable AOAs in SoCal.
Figure 2. Preliminary GIS Model results of suitable and unsuitable AOAs in the GoM.
Our preliminary GIS Model identifies a significantly larger portion of area suitable for aquaculture in the GoM compared to SoCal. A total area of 47,474 km2 out of 650,726 km2 or 6.80% of the model extent falls within the parameter boundaries outlined (Figure 2 and Table 6). The suitable area is dispersed throughout gulf state offshore waters, with two larger expanses off the western coast of Florida. Unlike SoCal, the parameter that is most limiting in the GoM is marine protected areas. This eliminated 650,725 km2 out of 698,198 km2 and accounted for 93.20% of the model extent (Table 6). In contrast to SoCal, the least limiting parameter in the GoM is maximum sea surface temperature. An area encompassing 99.92% (712,331 km2 out of 712,906 km2) of the model extent is within the acceptable maximum sea surface temperature range.
*The total km2 for parameters equals the area of individual data in raw form. Total km2 of the preliminary GIS Model results grid are the area where parameters overlap.
Table 6. Total km2 for each parameter to determine suitable and unsuitable AOAs in the GoM.
1.3 Recommendations for Full Study for Question Two
1.3.1 Additional Factors to be Considered
This pilot analysis has potential use as a screening tool to significantly reduce the areas under consideration. NOAA should consider more than the five factors assessed in our preliminary GIS Model (Table 1). Other environmental parameters are also essential in siting AOA locations and would be used in a full Model but have been omitted from this response based on time constraints. Table 7 below lists the parameters a full Model could assess to properly site AOAs. This list is not exhaustive, and we would heavily involve stakeholders in our approach.
Table 7. Suggested parameters to consider in future AOA siting Model.
1.3.2 Incorporation of Climate Change It is vital to consider the impending changes in environmental factors due to climate change, helping to ensure proper siting and full life expectancy of AOAs (Reid et al. 2019). Offshore aquaculture is tied to the physical state of the regional water. As previously discussed, hydrodynamic properties and abiotic factors such as water temperature and pH are primary determinants of growth rates of certain species and the overall production efficiency of AOAs in SoCal, the GoM, and other U.S. waters. The effects of anthropogenic climate change are expected to have profound effects on several important siting parameters including a projected increase in global sea surface temperatures (Ruela et al. 2020) and concomitant decline in pH (Stewart-Sinclair et al. 2020). As such, the impacts of climate change may shift species distributions, potentially changing spatial use conflict areas which will add important indicators into AOA siting. Climate change may further negatively affect ecosystem stability and energy flow, decreasing the ability for aquaculture to provide ecosystem services (Chapman et al. 2020). Thus, current and future environmental conditions of U.S. waters will play a large role in determining locations and species that can thrive in an AOA.
2.0: Conclusions and Recommendations
Using the available geospatial data and general species requirements to provide our high-level preliminary GIS Model assessment of SoCal and the GoM regions, our recommendations are as follows:
* We recommend the two areas south of the Channel Islands off SoCal (Figure 1) should be considered for further assessment to identify future AOAs.
* We recommend the large region off the west coast of Florida south of Sarasota should be considered for further assessment to identify future AOAs in the GoM (Figure 2).
Further assessments of the parameters detailed in Table 7 should be analyzed further to identify the social, abiotic, and cultural resource factors that will determine the siting of AOAs in U.S. waters.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 -- Jim Estes, deputy director at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Tallahassee, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written on Dec. 10, 2020, and posted on Dec. 18, 2020:
* * *
The Division of Marine Fisheries Management of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has coordinated agency review of the Federal Register Notice (FRN) for a Request for Information on Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs), and provide the following comments and information for consideration by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). FWC comments and information are specific to waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) adjacent to Florida and for all marine species that may be cultured within AOAs.
Question 1
1. With input from industry and based on previous permit applications, we have identified the water depths and maximum distances from shore (see a. and b. below) that we expect to support aquaculture within Federal waters (i.e., U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) of the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California as starting points for the process of identifying AOAs. Are there types of offshore aquaculture that these areas may or may not support, or are there other water depths and maximum distances from shore that should be considered, and why?
a. In the Gulf of Mexico, we are looking at areas that:
i. Are within the depth range of 50 to 150 meters.
ii. Do not have a specified maximum distance from shore.
b. In Southern California, we are looking at areas that:
i. Are within the depth range of 10 to 150 meters.
ii. Are a maximum distance of 25 nautical miles from shore.
FWC Comments for Question 1
NOAA is investigating areas in Federal waters of the GoM for AOA designation that are within the depth range of 50 to 150 meters. Attachment 1 identifies the substantial area within the GoM adjacent to Florida that is not being considered by this depth range (boundary of State-Federal waters out to 50 meter depth), and this area could be 20 miles to 100+ miles offshore depending on which area off Florida a culturist would site their operation.
AOA comments submitted to NOAA by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (dated December 7, 2020) stated:
In an expert survey conducted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) Division of Aquaculture in June 2019, this particular question was asked: "What do you consider an ideal distance to shore for an offshore aquaculture operation in Florida Gulf waters?" Answers varied from the specific (e.g., 5-9 nm, "a 30-minute boat ride") to the general (e.g., "Deep enough to raise fish and close enough to be practical") but made clear that there needs to be a balance between environmental considerations, competing uses of the space and practicality for business operations.
Given that FDACS survey respondents generally identified that the ideal distance from shore for an aquaculture operation is "Deep enough to raise fish and close enough to be practical", and based on the substantial size of the area identified in Attachment 1 that is not being included for consideration for this AOA planning process, it would appear that NOAA is not considering areas as part of this AOA planning process that would be feasible to conduct aquaculture activities in Federal waters adjacent to Florida.
Question 2
Are there specific locations or habitats within Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico or Southern California that should be considered for AOAs? Are there specific locations that should be avoided? Please be as specific as possible and include latitude and longitude or defining landmarks. Please indicate why such areas should be considered or avoided, for example, favorable biological parameters, water quality (e.g., nutrients or other constituents that might make an area favorable), proximity to infrastructure (e.g., ports, processing plants, hatcheries or nurseries that could supply fingerlings for grow-out), relationship to other planned initiatives, etc.
FWC Comments for Question 2
There are some areas of the GoM seafloor within the 50-150m depth range that have been well-mapped because they are unique and have received special research attention. Examples of these areas are: Pully Ridge, The Elbow, Florida Middle Ground, Madison-Swanson, Steamboat Lumps, and The Edges. But other than these types of areas, there is very limited mapping of seafloor type within the 50-150m depth range (availability of seafloor mapping data improves both around the escarpment - 200m+ and near-shore).
In the absence of sufficient mapping data, the following general features within the 50-150m depth range are ecologically significant and should be avoided:
* Structural features - All areas of hard bottom, particularly high relief hard bottom or hard bottom areas supporting the growth of structure-creating biota such as sponges, octocorals and soft corals, with an appropriate buffer around these areas. At a minimum, facilities should only be considered for siting far enough up the predominate current and away from hardbottom such that physical disturbance, nutrient contamination, or disease vectors from activities associated with aquaculture facilities do not adversely affect benthic resources or native species found in hardbottom areas (recommend a minimum of 1 km).
* Geological features - Blue holes, ledges, ridges, escarpments, underwater springs. Siting near geological features should also have an appropriate buffer as identified above for structural features.
Additionally, the following features with a biological component that have likely been previously identified by NOAA should also be avoided:
* Deep water corals (https://gulfcouncil.org/fishery-management/implementedplans/coral/)
* Known spawning aggregations
* Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) including focal migration corridors
* Designated critical habitat or other identified habitat for marine mammals or other species listed pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act or the Endangered Species Act. In particular, the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale was recently listed and it is a year-round resident of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. NOAA has recently defined a core habitat area in advance of critical habitat designation for this critically endangered whale believed to have < 50 individuals.
* Areas designated as Marine Protected Areas, Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs), or other similar designations
Question 4
Are there specific locations within Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico or Southern California that should be avoided because of concerns about harmful algal blooms (HABs) or impaired water quality? Please specify whether these concerns are related to: (a) Aquaculture activities being impacted by HABs and impaired water quality, or (b) aquaculture activities contributing to HABs and impaired water quality?
FWC Comments for Question 4
There is no way to predict the occurrence, precise location, or duration of HABs so there are no specific locations within Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico that FWC could recommend avoiding due to concerns for HABs. FWC does recommend that NOAA incorporate consideration of data that can be indicators of nutrient levels into AOA planning processes such as Chlorophyll a (CHl-a) and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM). But ultimately aquaculture activities must be managed and conducted in a manner to avoid creating or exacerbating conditions that may support the development and persistence of HABs.
(a) Karenia brevis, also known as red tide, is a dinoflagellate that produces neurotoxic brevetoxins and blooms nearly annually in southwest Florida (e.g., over the past 25 years, 2010 was the only year without a bloom). Monitoring data for K. brevis in Florida is available via the FWRI HAB Monitoring database (email: HABData@myfwc.com). Blooms (>100,000 cells L-1) also occur regularly along Florida's Panhandle region (i.e., with 22 events since 1964) and often co-occur with blooms in the southwest region and can even extend further west to other Gulf states, or around the southern tip of Florida and along the Atlantic coast. Blooms can extend >100 km offshore and are often patchy in space and time, yet can persist for months to years.
Relatively few samples are collected offshore relative to those collected in estuaries and along the coast, and sampling effort in general has varied widely over time. Brevetoxins from red tide blooms may impact aquaculture activities through mass mortalities of fish and other animal species including marine mammals (dolphins and manatees), birds, invertebrates (arthropods, cnidarians, tunicates, molluscs), and sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico and occasionally along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Mechanisms can include trophic transfer of, or direct exposure to, brevetoxins or for some wildlife, low dissolved oxygen resulting from sustained blooms.
(b) Blooms of Karenia brevis typically begin offshore at depth and are brought inshore by ocean currents. Lab and field studies have shown that K. brevis can use a broad diversity of nutrients, including natural and anthropogenic sources. K. brevis occurs throughout the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the year (although blooms typically start in late summer or fall) and can persist across a broad temperature and salinity range. Decomposing fish are thought to provide a source of nutrients, and concerns for aquaculture activities contributing to HABs and impairing water quality stem from uneaten food, decomposing fish from normal operations, and fish waste which will cause eutrophication that could contribute to the development and/or intensification of algal blooms such as K. brevis as well as low dissolved oxygen. Resulting issues may or may not be solely localized, given the typical currents on the West Florida shelf and how they impact local retention as well as connectivity between offshore and nearshore regions.
Question 6
Is there information that may not be readily available or accessible online that would be useful for AOA planning processes in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California?
This includes spatial data or geographic information system (GIS) layers representing environmental and socioeconomic considerations, or a point of contact for these data, for the following categories:
- Biophysical/oceanographic (wave climate, currents, bathymetry)
- Natural resources (minerals, energy resources, fishes and aquatic organisms, protected species and habitats, coral reefs, biodiversity)
- Social and cultural resources
- Government boundaries
- Industry (fishing, energy production, transportation, communication cables)

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 -- Alex Reed, director of the Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection at the Florida Environmental Protection Department, Tallahassee, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written on Dec. 16, 2020, and posted on Dec. 18, 2020:
* * *
On October 23, 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requested comments regarding the identification of areas within the Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Southern California for the first two Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOA).
AOAs are small defined geographic area(s) that have been evaluated for suitability for commercial aquaculture. NOAA plans to identify subset areas within the AOAs that are environmentally, socially, and economically appropriate for commercial aquaculture. The creation of these areas does not preclude the need for permits or authorizations for aquaculture structures or activities.
On May 7, 2020, the White House issued an Executive Order on Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth (E.O. 13921), which requires the Secretary of Commerce to identify geographic areas containing locations suitable for commercial aquaculture, and complete a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for each area to assess the impact of siting aquaculture facilities there. NOAA selected Federal waters within the Gulf of Mexico and off Southern California, south of Point Conception, as the regions where the first two AOAs will be located.
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has coordinated a review of the proposed project. The Florida Department of Agriculture Division of Aquaculture (FLDAC) submitted their letter directly to NOAA on December 7, 2020 delineating their comments and concerns. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission delineates several habitat types that should be considered and avoided for designation of AOA's, including hardbottom, livebottom, sensitive geological features, essential fish habitats, designated critical habitats. Additional concerns for the State that should be considered when determining any AOAs offshore of Florida include sensitive habitats/resources, military uses, recreational and commercial fisheries and other possible stakeholders.
One of the sensitive habitats is the Florida Reef Tract. Florida is the only state in the continental United States to have extensive shallow coral reef formations along its coasts. This reef tract extends for nearly 360 miles from St. Lucie inlet in Martin County to the Dry Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico and is the third largest barrier reef ecosystem in the world. The Florida Reef Tract contains similar coral formations to those found in the Bahamas and Caribbean Sea. The northern reef tract was designed by the Florida legislature as the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Ecosystem Conservation Area in 2018 and the southern extent of the reef tract lies within the boundaries of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). The FKNMS encompasses 2,800-square nautical miles that surrounds the entire archipelago of the Florida Keys and includes the productive waters of Florida Bay, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The coral reef communities continue northward in deeper waters along the gulf coast of Florida to the Florida Middle Grounds, a series of submerged pinnacles rising to within 60-80 feet of the surface located about 100 miles northwest of St. Petersburg, FL.
Most recently the Florida Reef Tract has been affected by a new environmental crisis of an unprecedented disease outbreak. Beginning in 2014 with isolated diseased coral colonies near Key Biscayne off the coast of Miami-Dade County, the disease outbreak had continued to spread. This disease outbreak will make the remaining corals and coral reefs more vulnerable and sensitive to any activities that could further impact the health of the reef tract.
There are several areas along Florida's coast that are designated as Outstanding Florida Waters including parks, aquatic preserves and national estuarine research reserves. There should be a sufficient distance from those areas that would preclude any downstream impacts or exceedance of state water quality standards. The GIS data layer that specifically includes all the boundaries of the OFWs of the state can be found at https://geodata.dep.state.fl.us/datasets/681b93ec295f4003abb5a97cd5b51173_0.
Additionally, deposits of beach quality sand should be avoided while designating possible AOAs. Florida invests millions of dollars annually to protect, preserve and manage our valuable sandy beaches and adjacent coastal systems. In many areas of the state, the beach and dune system is often the first line of defense against storms, absorbing wave energy and reducing the damage to upland structures. The ability to maintain these beach systems is dependent on the increasingly limited sand resources that exist nearshore and offshore of the coast, forcing the use of sand from the Outer Continental Shelf. Increased offshore activities could impact the quality and quantity of sand available for critically important beach maintenance projects.
Military training areas onshore and offshore Florida are vital to our military's ability to maintain readiness and conduct activities critical to our nation's security. Florida's military bases are dependent on access to the air and sea space the Gulf of Mexico Range Complex (GOMEX Range Complex) provides. The GOMEX Range Complex is larger than all other training ranges inside the continental United States combined and has been in use for over 60 years. The GOMEX Range Complex stretches from the Florida Panhandle (commonly referred to as the Military Mission Line) south to Key West and encompasses 180,000 square miles in the eastern Gulf of Mexico./1
The GOMEX Range Complex supports missions at many installations including NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, Hurlburt Air Force Base, Duke Field, Eglin Air Force Base, NSA Panama City, Tyndall Air Force Base, MacDill Air Force Base, and NAS Key West.
The Florida Department of State recommends that cultural resources such as shipwrecks inundated archaeological sites be considered in determining locations for AOAs. They recommend contacting the Florida Master Site File Office for listings and GIS information of sites and cultural resource surveys for the proposed AOAs. In addition, an assessment of the cultural resources should be conducted, and the DOS would like to review the Florida AOA locations to ensure all concerns have been addressed.
Enclosed please find additional information from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Department of State. Thank you for the opportunity to review the proposed project and we look forward to working with NOAA regarding the possible designation of AOAs in the Gulf of Mexico.
Should you have any questions, please contact Shana Kinsey-Carlsen at shana.kinsey@floridadep.gov or 850-245-2185.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 -- John Williams, executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, Tarpon Springs, Florida, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written and posted on Dec. 21, 2020:
* * *
The Southern Shrimp Alliance (SSA) appreciates the opportunity to provide the following comments regarding NOAA's Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOA) initiative, and the larger federal initiative to facilitate marine aquaculture development.
SSA's membership is comprised of many small, family-owned businesses in the shrimp fisheries and associated shoreside enterprises operating in coastal communities in all eight warm-water shrimp-producing states from North Carolina to Texas.
The following comments are in two parts. The first part responds to two specific questions set forth in the Request for Information (RFI), and the second part addresses a number of issues that transcend the siting issues addressed in the AOA initiative but which we believe are central to the larger federal initiative to facilitate the development an offshore aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
SSA further notes that it received a briefing from NOAA staff on the AOA initiative on December 11, 2020, which was very informative. We were favorably impressed by the level of detail and thought that these NOAA staff are putting into this important marine spatial planning exercise which we find promising. We look forward to continuing this dialogue with NOAA, including an opportunity to discuss the questions we have raised in the following comments.
Thank you for your consideration,
John Williams,
Executive Director
* * *
Comments Specific to Questions in the RFI
Question 1:
As stated in this question, the 50-150m depth range was identified "as starting points for the process of identifying AOAs." In his Executive Order 13921, the President directed the Secretary of Commerce to "seek to minimize unnecessary resource use conflicts as appropriate, including conflicts with... commercial and recreational fishing" in identifying AOAs.
Extensive and precise fishing effort data for the penaeid shrimp trawl fishery has been collected and analyzed by NOAA since at least 2004 through the use of Electronic Logbooks (ELBs). This data indicates there is a sharp demarcation of fishing effort in the penaeid shrimp trawl fishery at approximately the 90 m depth contour in the north/central and western Gulf.
SSA recommends that NOAA can most effectively ensure that the President's objective to minimize unnecessary conflicts with the penaeid shrimp trawl fishery is achieved by establishing the minimum depth of any AOA as 90 m in those areas.
Precise fishing effort data for the deep-water royal red shrimp trawl fishery has also been collected and analyzed by NOAA through the use of Electronic Logbooks (ELBs). Separately, AOAs should not be established in these specific areas of fishing effort in order to minimize unnecessary conflicts of aquaculture activities in the Gulf with this fishery.
The precision of this fishing effort data has enabled the shrimp fishery to work with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council ("Council") through the Shrimp Advisory Panel to very successfully delineate coral protection sites in the Gulf on a very fine scale - both as HACPs and within National Marine Sanctuaries. This painstaking but rewarding process has yielded a win-win for the fishery and coral resources. This fine-scale analysis of the fishing effort data and the coral habitat location data should provide the model for how to properly identify AOAs.
Question 2.
Areas to be avoided for AOAs are the locations of penaeid and royal red shrimp fishing effort as precisely documented in NOAAs ELB shrimp effort data. As recommended above, an effective way to achieve the objective of minimizing conflicts with the penaeid shrimp fishery would be to limit AOAs to beyond the 90 m depth contour. With respect to the royal red shrimp fishery, areas to be avoided should be identified in the localized areas of fishing effort based on a precise analysis of the agency's ELB effort data for that fishery.
GENERAL COMMENTS
Of paramount interest to SSA is, of course, to prevent any adverse impacts of offshore aquaculture on the domestic shrimp fishery. Historically, the shrimp fishery has been and continues to be the most valuable commercial fishery in the Gulf of Mexico and is a very important source of employment and economy in the region. For many years it was also the most valuable fishery in the Nation.
It is not without some irony and sensitivity for the domestic shrimp industry to be commenting on this initiative to facilitate aquaculture development in the Gulf given that the primary reason it is no longer the most valuable fishery in the Nation, and why so many fishermen and vessels have been forced from the fishery, has been the severe price-depressing effects imported farm-raised shrimp continue to have in the US and global marketplace. Shrimp prices paid to U.S. shrimp fishermen have never recovered from the advent and rapid expansion of foreign farmed shrimp production and imports roughly two decades ago.
SSA's believes the development, operation and management of a new aquaculture industry and any privileges granted to it to profit from the use of public resources should not be achieved at any detriment to US shrimp fishermen. SSA is likewise concerned with the impacts of this new development on other traditional fisheries for wild stocks in the Gulf, and on American fishing communities that have supported and depended on shrimp and other fisheries along the coast for many decades. A marine aquaculture industry is not a legitimate substitute for the heritage or economy of our fishing communities, or for the optimum utilization of our nation's wild fishery resources.
Therefore, the question of aquaculture facility siting being addressed through the AOA process is of paramount interest and concern, and so we will be working through this process to ensure that the President' stated objective "to minimize unnecessary resource use conflicts" is achieved. That said, aquaculture facility siting decisions are not our only concern.
As we read it, a premise of the President's Executive Order 13921 is to increase US seafood production by supplementing the harvest of wild caught species with cultured product that will help to reduce the US trade deficit in seafood products by increasing US production to satisfy US market demand. More explicitly, the Executive Order states among its Purposes is to "revitalize our Nation's seafood industry; get more Americans back to work; and put healthy, safe food on our families' tables."
With these core overarching purposes and goals in mind, one would reasonably expect that nothing in this initiative should have the effect of reducing any aspect of US seafood production. But in reality, this could be a result due to the loss of access to traditional fishing grounds through poor aquaculture facility siting decisions. It could also be a result of aquaculture production having the impact of distorting the existing supply/demand for wild-caught species and reducing prices paid to US fishermen - rendering their businesses unsustainable and reducing fishery production. And still further, to the extent the US government provides a disproportionate level of subsidies or other economic support for the aquaculture industry, such as through Congressional appropriations and/or federal grants, US fisheries for the same species will face a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace and a likely reduction in production.
A strategy to reduce the US seafood trade deficit that has the effect of reducing the viability of US fishery businesses and the production of wild caught seafood as a trade-off for increasing the production of cultured seafood is, of course, not rational. The goal cannot be to reduce the seafood trade deficit at any cost, if that cost is the reduction of wild shrimp production or any other wild stock fisheries.
We further call this to the attention of the Council. In the very same Executive Order 13921, the President calls on the Council to generate recommendations "to reduce burdens on domestic fishing and to increase production within sustainable fisheries". We hope that the agency and the Council can see the potential for a stark conflict between this directive and any aquaculture development activity that would place new burdens on US wild stock fisheries or reduce their viability or production.
At the same time, we hope that the agency and the Council can see the potential for a conflict between their fundamental statutory mandate set forth in Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) National Standard 1 and any aquaculture development activity implemented under any legal authority that would have the effect of limiting the ability of wild fisheries to achieve the Optimum Yield (OY) - or, for that OY, as defined in the MSA, to "provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation".
These are just some of the difficult issues that we believe must be considered, not just in the initial AOA siting process, but also in the overall marine aquaculture development initiative inspired, in large part, through the President's Executive Order 13921.
As noted above, there are, a number of additional issues that must be correctly addressed collectively if offshore aquaculture is to have a viable future in the Gulf or anywhere in the U.S. We present each of those issues here as a series of questions which we ask the agency to consider and to provide a response.
1. Navigation
This is in part a siting issue relative to the location of other activities such as fishing activity, vessel traffic and shipping lanes, etc. which are being addressed in the AOA process. But it is also a 'safety of life at sea' issue.
The federal government must commit itself to ensuring the establishment and enforcement of sufficient navigational safety standards and requirements for the lighting and other physical and/or electronic marking of aquaculture facilities, including the marking on navigational charts and other aids to navigation.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?
2. Prevention
The federal government must commit itself to an aggressive policy, and to developing an effective plan, for the prevention of what are in many cases the irreversible impacts of natural disasters, disease, escapement and genetics.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government ensure that facilities are designed, constructed and operated to state-of-the-art standards in order to maximize the prevention of -
- Storm damage or destruction?
- The ensuing debris field will impact navigation, marine habitats, and fisheries including especially the shrimp trawl fisheries.
- Disease and its spread to the ecosystem including valuable wild stocks of fish and shellfish?
- Infectious diseases have been widespread in marine aquaculture globally.
- Escapements?
- The escapement of endemic species, non-endemic species and/or genetic variants of endemic species may adversely impact the ecosystem and wild species.
- Should eligible species be limited to endemic species? To Council-managed species? Or, to those species for which there is not a wild stock fishery?
One element of an effective prevention strategy should be the requirement for operators to perform demonstration projects which can be monitored and tested in situ - especially for those projects where there may be new technologies, species and/or uncertainties regarding efficacy, safety, etc.
3. Remediation.
The reality is that it may not always be possible to mitigate or remediate the adverse impacts of natural disasters, disease or escapements at any cost.
Nevertheless, the federal government must commit itself to developing a remediation plan that sets forth actions to be taken by both federal/state agencies and the facility operator in the event of a natural disaster, disease outbreak or escapement.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?
4. Indemnification.
The federal government must commit itself to ensuring that aquaculture facility operators are held liable - and have sufficient resources to pay - for the costs of the timely mitigation and/or remediation of the inevitable impacts of natural disasters, disease and escapement.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?
In order to ensure that facility operators remain susceptible to liability enforcement, should such operators be limited to the same US ownership and control requirements that apply to U.S. fishing vessels? Both the House and Senate recently passed with veto-proof majorities H.R. 6396; the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act which includes provisions subjecting offshore wind development activities to the Jones Act. Should offshore aquaculture facilities and associated support vessels likewise be covered by the Jones Act?
It seems likely that many of these potential adverse impacts will be a consequence of damage to aquaculture facilities caused by the increasing number of powerful storms including Category 5 hurricanes in the Gulf. This raises the question - does it make sense to establish offshore AOAs in the Gulf of Mexico at all? Is there a man-made structure known to man that is capable of withstanding a Category 5 hurricane in the Gulf? Is there any chance at all that these aquaculture facilities would survive such storms? Is such damage or destruction, and the consequent adverse impacts, many of which are likely irreversible, just a situation of WHEN and not IF?
Is the ultimate solution to achieving essential Prevention, Remediation and Indemnification objectives not to develop offshore aquaculture in such a dangerous and vulnerable physical environment in the first place?
5. Facility decommissioning.
The federal government must commit itself to ensuring the timely removal of facilities and 'to return the ocean and seafloor to it pre-permitted condition', analogous to what BOEM requires for OCS oil and gas facilities. Facilities left in place too long - perhaps even abandoned for financial reasons - must be removed to avoid inevitable impacts. Debris left behind on the seafloor prevents fishing access and/or causes gear damage.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?
6. Veterinary activities.
The federal government must commit itself to ensuring the correct regulation or prohibition, as appropriate, of antibiotics, antifungal agents and any other chemical or drug treatments that may harm wild stock species, the larger ecosystem or human health. Environmental contamination with antibiotics, with the subsequent contamination of wild species, has been a serious problem in large scale aquaculture in other nations including, especially, with shrimp.
Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?
7. Authorities
In each of the brief discussions above we have asked the question: "Through what mechanisms and authorities will the federal government achieve this objective?"
A primary reason for asking this question is that, as we understand it, NOAA will not be a permitting agency. As per judicial action, the agency does not have such authority pursuant to the MSA through which it otherwise ensures the sustainability of US fisheries and fishery resources, and the protection of sensitive marine habitats.
The President's Executive Order 13921 provides authority for an aquaculture development initiative in the Gulf, but with few if any specific requirements for addressing the issues we've raised above.
The same Executive Order indicates that there will be promulgate a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the AOAs which will provide some basis for agency enforcement and judicial review of compliance with NEPA. But will that provide a basis for judicial review of, for example, whether NOAA achieved the President's objective to 'minimize unnecessary resource use conflicts with commercial fisheries'?
Further, the Executive Order also appears to contemplate a single process for issuing permits through the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE). The ACOE is a rather unfamiliar authority in the fisheries world and not one that has a history of competence in fishery conservation and management.
So, while it appears that NOAA has been tasked with some form of oversight responsibility for a federal permitting process, it remains very unclear how it will ensure that the numerous issues and questions we've identified will be sufficiently or effectively addressed and enforced - and to what extent they will be subject to judicial review. It is also unclear how stakeholders like the shrimp fishery can effectively participate in permitting and other decision-making under such a disjointed regulatory structure.
While SSA certainly had its concerns with the Gulf Council's Offshore Aquaculture FMP, at least it was a Plan with a coherent set of standards and requirements, and a centralized and readily accessible decision-making process. That does not appear to be the case under the new, larger federal initiative to facilitate marine aquaculture.
Therefore, if the federal government is going to facilitate and pursue the development of a marine aquaculture industry, then
1. it must develop in advance a comprehensive, coherent, integrated plan to address a priori the at a minimum the issues we have identified; and
2. NOAA must seek statutory authority from Congress to issue permits and provide a centralized, integrated and accessible permitting authority and planning process for effectively regulating this industry.
This AOA process represents but one element of such a comprehensive integrated approach.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 -- Aaron Adams, director of science and conservation at Bonefish and Tarpon Trust, West Palm Beach, Florida, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was posted on Dec. 21, 2020:
* * *
This comment lists some of the problems with siting an Aquaculture Opportunity Area in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The area being considered is too important for existing economically important fisheries, and presents too many existing environmental risks to allow aquaculture.
The recreational fisheries for bonefish, tarpon, and permit are economically important. For example, the flats fishery has an annual economic impact that exceeds $465 million in the Florida Keys, and $55 million in Belize. These species are a major component of the recreational fishery in the Everglades region with an annual economic impact exceeding $1 billion. The annual economic impact of the tarpon fishery in Charlotte Harbor, FL exceeds $120 million. More broadly, the annual economic impact of saltwater recreational fishing in Florida exceeds $12 billion. These fisheries depend upon healthy habitats, high water quality, and disease- and contaminant-free waters.
The establishment of offshore finfish aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico insufficiently protects our recreational fisheries and their habitats. Our top concerns include:
- Fish farms create a high amount of waste, adding nutrients to the waters in which they are placed. These additional nutrients contribute to algae blooms and environmental degradation. Although the standard approach is to place offshore fish cages in areas with moderate currents so that the wastewater is carried away from the cage, the dilution of this waste does not remove it from the system. Since Florida's Gulf coast already suffers from red tides that are exacerbated by human-introduced nutrients, we are concerned that offshore fish cages will contribute to the issue of excessive nutrients. This is especially true given that red tide blooms start in an offshore environment that is normally nutrient-limited. Red tides cause large-scale fish kills and close shellfish harvest. Increasing red tide occurrence will negatively impact tarpon and the tarpon fishery, as well as other fisheries.
- The entire region is impacted by red tides. What happens when a red tide occurs and kills fish in offshore fish cages? Such a high density of dead fish is an environmental threat.
- The presence of large fish cages in offshore waters will aggregate wild fish, acting as a Fish Attracting Device (FAD), which may impact fish migrations and reproduction in two ways.
- First, the cages will likely attract sharks. Since tarpon seasonally migrate through areas preferred by offshore aquaculture, tarpon may be exposed to high encounter rates with sharks along their migration pathways. There are similar concerns for other migratory species.
- Second, for species that are already overfished, FADs, such as a fish cage, will increase the catch rate, and thus harvest, contributing to overfishing.
- Current evaluative criteria do not account for fish migratory pathways. Disruption of migrations can have population-level impacts on economically important wild fish species.
- Current evaluative criteria do not include acknowledgment of data-limited situations. Data are limited on many species that live in the Gulf of Mexico, including data identifying the types, spatial extent, and quality of essential habitats for many fish species. Thus, models being used to evaluate potential sites for aquaculture operations are fundamentally deficient.
- It would be beneficial to more proactively control the use of pharmaceuticals and other prophylactics. Since pharmaceutical contamination has been shown to affect fish behavior, migrations, and reproduction, this is a concern for native species. Indeed, preliminary data from BTT research shows that bonefish in the Florida Keys have numerous pharmaceuticals in their tissues. Adding more pharmaceuticals to the ecosystem via fish cages is not wise.
- More extensive pre-site selection work should be done to better describe the fisheries in locations proposed for offshore cages. At present, the assessment process does not include sufficient information to determine the existing fisheries and how they might be impacted. For areas that may impact existing fisheries, a system whereby aquaculture companies post a bond to cover negative impacts to existing fisheries should be considered. Similarly, a more rigorous monitoring system - before site selection as well as during cage operation - should be considered. This should include biological data (e.g., plankton community, fish community) and extensive water quality data (e.g., nutrients) over time to account for seasonal or other time-based changes.
- There is a high likelihood that offshore cages will not be safe from hurricanes. This is for two reasons. First, the Gulf of Mexico is a high-frequency hurricane region, so it is a near certainty that offshore cages will be in the path of a tropical storm or hurricane, as shown by consultation of the US National Hurricane Center database (https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/). For example, since 1852, there have been 77 tropical storms or hurricanes that have passed within 65 miles of a site permitted to Kampachi Farms. Second, the Gulf of Mexico is so shallow that the standard approach to protect cages from storms - lowering the cages toward the bottom with an anchoring system - will not work. The Ekman Depth (depth to which wind-induced currents are felt) for Hurricane Florence (a Category 4 hurricane in 2018) was 250', much deeper than the depths (70') at which cage sites are being proposed. Impacts from hurricanes would include destruction of the cage, the cage breaking loose, escape of caged fish into the native population.
- The high density of fish that will be grown in cages will make these areas hotspots for disease and parasites. This has occurred in other areas where offshore aquaculture is conducted. We are concerned about the impacts of these diseases and parasites on tarpon and other native species. Similarly, escape of fish from cages may also contribute to spreading disease.
- Aquaculture activities that are currently suitable are those for oysters and clams in nearshore waters, which have proven to be sustainable with minimal environmental impact.
- Consideration should be given to land-based fish culture. Land-based operations allow the control of effluent and escapes, thus avoiding many of the concerns with open ocean cage culture.
Bonefish & Tarpon Trust is an international, science-based, 501(c)3 non-profit, conservation organization headquartered in Miami, FL. BTT is dedicated to the conservation of the economically and culturally important finfish species bonefish, tarpon, permit--the species, their habitats, and the larger fisheries they support. We work in a broad geography that spans the southeastern US, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Basin, and western North Atlantic.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 -- Portia Sapp, director of the Aquaculture Division at the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Department, Tallahassee, has issued a public comment on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notice entitled "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas". The comment was written on Dec. 7, 2020, and posted on Dec. 9, 2020:
* * *
This letter serves as official comment from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in response to the NOAA "Aquaculture Opportunity Areas 2020" Request for Information (Docket # NOAA-NMFS-2020-0118). All comments below are written in the context of the Gulf of Mexico region; in particular, the Gulf coast of Florida. All references cited are listed after the written comments. We thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this effort and look forward to working with you in the future.
Sincerely,
Portia Sapp, Director
Division of Aquaculture
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
* * *
1. Are there types of offshore aquaculture that these areas may or may not support, or are there other water depths and maximum distances from shore that should be considered, and why?
Offshore aquaculture at the proposed depths should focus on finfish production, or integrated multitrophic aquaculture. Seaweed and shellfish can both be produced at far shallower depths and not require the financial overhead of operating systems for those species that far offshore. However, the minimum acceptable depth will vary based on cage design and size, current speed, wave energy and hurricane risk as well as the specific species and life stage being raised.
Although there is no maximum distance from shore specified, siting AOAs must consider distances to and availability of necessary land-based infrastructure such as ports and marinas, hatcheries and nurseries, processing facilities and distribution networks. The time and expense spent on travel is a significant consideration for operations that should be included when siting AOAs. Locations too far offshore or too far from needed infrastructure may significantly reduce efficiency and viability of operations (viz-a-viz fuel, time, vessel maintenance, reduced health and quality of product, etc.).
In an expert survey conducted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) Division of Aquaculture in June 2019, this particular question was asked: "What do you consider an ideal distance to shore for an offshore aquaculture operation in Florida Gulf waters?" Answers varied from the specific (e.g., 5-9 nm, "a 30-minute boat ride") to the general (e.g., "Deep enough to raise fish and close enough to be practical") but made clear that there needs to be a balance between environmental considerations, competing uses of the space and practicality for business operations.
2. Are there specific locations or habitats within Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico or Southern California that should be considered for AOAs? Are there specific locations that should be avoided? Please be as specific as possible and include latitude and longitude or defining landmarks. Please indicate why such areas should be considered or avoided, for example, favorable biological parameters, water quality (e.g., nutrients or other constituents that might make an area favorable), proximity to infrastructure (e.g., ports, processing plants, hatcheries or nurseries that could supply fingerlings for grow-out), relationship to other planned initiatives, etc.
Florida is ideally suited to lead the nation in aquaculture production in the coming decades. Florida aquaculture has more than doubled in farm abundance over the past 30 years and continues to expand in production volume and diversity. Florida's vast coastal region and climate make it ideal for aquaculture and the development of unique, high-value species such as cobia, snapper, grouper and jacks. In addition, Florida has a rich maritime culture and strong infrastructure in place to support expanding aquaculture. Florida has a large economic demand for fresh seafood, currently served at some 41,000 restaurants to 21.5 million residents and 126 million annual visitors. Florida has existing commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, and seafood jobs and business infrastructure, including seafood processors and wholesalers, distribution networks, markets and working waterfront communities throughout the state. Florida also has the bipartisan support of political leaders for developing offshore aquaculture in the state, including Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried and Senator Marco Rubio.
In addition, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) has also been working closely with the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) for over a year to identify specific regions in state waters that show potential for offshore aquaculture development.
We have conducted a scientifically-rigorous spatial siting analysis with over 250 GIS data layers, including: high resolution bathymetry and current speed; military; navigation; energy infrastructure; commercial shipping; commercial and recreational vessel traffic, including fishing; critical and essential fish habitat; HAPCs and other areas used for protection and management of natural resources; cultural resources; and recreation and tourism.
Based on this analysis of competing uses and site suitability, we have identified three potential regions in state waters that could support development of offshore aquaculture (Figure 1). Based on current and anticipated social license conflicts as well as the location of existing maritime and seafood infrastructure such as ports and processing facilities, the areas offshore of Pensacola and Apalachicola show the most promise for further exploration (see the green and blue areas in Figure 1 below). While federal and state waters will differ, siting AOAs in federal waters adjacent or near to areas that show high potential for aquaculture development in state waters could have multiple benefits (i.e., help facilitate more effective monitoring, enforcement and data collection efforts; streamline the federal review process when siting AOAs; create synergies within and among businesses in the seafood, aquaculture, tourism, restaurant and other maritime industries; and facilitate collaboration among the academic community and regulatory agencies).
The location of sensitive habitats, critical habitat and areas such as HAPCs and essential fish habitat should of course be considered when siting aquaculture operations. Federal waters along Florida's Gulf coast do contain hard bottom that is important for the life history of commercially important species, such as grouper and red snapper. Hard bottom as well as natural and artificial reefs should be avoided if there is potential for negative impacts with cultural and environmental resources. However, offshore structures are well known to act as aggregating devices for ecologically and economically-important fish species and other animals such as sharks and marine mammals (Bortone et al. 2011), thereby enhancing the effect of artificial reefs or natural hard bottom habitat for fishing and other ocean recreation. The potential for cooperation and connection between commercial fishing and offshore aquaculture should be considered when siting AOAs, as co-location may have positive synergistic effects and implications for commercial and recreational fishing, ocean recreation and fisheries management (see for example, Arechavala-Lopez et al. 2011, Callier et al. 2018, Clavelle et al. 2019).

4. Are there specific locations within Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico or Southern California that should be avoided because of concerns about harmful algal blooms (HABs) or impaired water quality? Please specify whether these concerns are related to: (a) Aquaculture activities being impacted by HABs and impaired water quality, or (b) aquaculture activities contributing to HABs and impaired water quality?
Red tide (Karenia brevis) is a significant concern and has caused devasting economic and ecological impacts for coastal residents and businesses in southwest Florida for many years. Red tide most commonly occurs along the coastline between Collier and Hernando counties.
Hurricanes and currents occasionally entrench red tide into the Panhandle from the southwest, and the southern Atlantic coastline is also impacted occasionally. While other HAB species do occur in Florida waters, they are limited to nearshore environments and are not a concern for federal water aquaculture sites. At present there are no offshore, feed-added aquaculture facilities in any state or federal waters off of Florida's Gulf coast, meaning that these HABs are not induced by aquaculture activities. Although siting should consider HAB "hotspots", planning for HABs such as red tide should be included in any farm plan, similar to preparing for and mitigating impacts of storms and hurricanes.
5 The Florida state map archive for red tide is hosted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) online at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/myfwc/sets/72157635398013168/. Additional data and information for red tide in Florida can be found at FWC's website: https://myfwc.com/research/redtide/.
5. Is there ongoing environmental, economic, or social science research that would assist in the identification and implementation of AOAs in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico or Southern California? If so, please describe in as much detail as is available.
The social and cultural components of aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico are perhaps the least well studied, as compared to environmental impacts, economics, technology, engineering, husbandry and animal health. Social license and public perception are consistently discussed as being crucial for aquaculture development (e.g., Knapp and Rubino 2016, Montgomery 2019) but to the best of our knowledge there is not a comprehensive literature on the topic specifically for the Gulf of Mexico (but see Camp et al. 2020). We know from current experience that public perception, misinformation and social license remain large hurdles to overcome in the Gulf of Mexico and the United States more broadly. Anecdotally and in practice we know that there is resistance to offshore aquaculture from vocal environmental groups and some commercial fishing groups in Florida. In the aforementioned FDACS 2019 expert aquaculture survey, "public perceptions or concerns" was ranked as one of the most negative interactions/impacts on farm operations and the permitting process (along with "access to capital or other financial considerations").
Notably, aquaculture presents a unique opportunity to diversify the business portfolio and income for existing fishers and others in the seafood industry, thus strengthening connections between the industries and enhancing resiliency of coastal communities overall. However, uncertainties remain about how and why fishers may participate, barriers to entry, the socioeconomic and sociocultural dynamics that may be a factor and what policy, management and institutional frameworks are needed for successful governance (e.g., Tango-Lowy and Robertson 2002, Pianka 2016, Morgan et al. 2017, Stoll et al. 2019). This work is ongoing globally and should be considered when siting AOAs.
At the same time, the FDACS Division of Aquaculture is currently planning initiatives to carry out such social science research for state waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, we plan to collaborate with stakeholders in the regions identified from the previously described NCCOS siting analysis (Pensacola and Apalachicola) to better understand their perceptions, values and sociocultural dynamics related to offshore aquaculture. Current commercial and recreational fishers, shellfish farmers and others in the seafood industry will be part of this work. Although we are planning to work with stakeholders on offshore aquaculture development in state waters, enhancing our understanding of stakeholder perceptions and values around offshore aquaculture should be applicable more broadly to AOAs in Florida.
6. Is there information that may not be readily available or accessible online that would be useful for AOA planning processes in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California? This includes spatial data or geographic information system (GIS) layers representing environmental and socioeconomic considerations, or a point of contact for these data, for the following categories:
--Biophysical/oceanographic (wave climate, currents, bathymetry)
--Natural resources (minerals, energy resources, fishes and aquatic organisms, protected species and habitats, coral reefs, biodiversity)
--Social and cultural resources
--Government boundaries
--Industry (fishing, energy production, transportation, communication cables)
--Military
--Navigation
Spatial data for many of the mentioned layers are currently available online from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (https://myfwc.com/research/gis/; Contact: Christi Santi; christi.santi@myfwc.com), Florida Department of Environmental Protection (https://floridadep.gov/otis/enterprise-application-services/gis; Contact: GIS.Librarian@dep.state.fl.us) and the Florida Department of State (Contact: Chris Fowler, christopher.fowler@dos.myflorida.com). Additional data gathered from a variety of state resources can be found at the State of Florida Geographic Data Portal online: https://geodata.myflorida.com/.
Data on social and cultural resources, military use, as well as fishing industry data are harder to come by and will likely require additional research. In particular, commercial fishing data as visualized and quantified using a combination of VMS and trip logbook data will be the best indicator of potential interactions with the commercial fishing industry in the Gulf (see for example, Cockrell 2018). These data are not publicly available and are currently held by NOAA's Southeast Regional Office and the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center.
Data on land-based point source wastewater inputs (outfalls and plumes) relative to aquaculture sites are also important to consider and to our knowledge are not readily available. While wastewater inputs may not directly reach aquaculture sites in federal waters, indirect impacts such as nutrient transport on currents or triggering a harmful algal bloom that may reach an aquaculture site are important to consider. In populated coastal cities such as Tampa and Sarasota in southwest Florida, where frequent storms and aging infrastructure lead to unintentional and intentional releases of partially-treated wastewater, inducing red tide (Karenia brevis) blooms that may impact aquaculture operations are a real concern.
12. If states express interest in developing offshore aquaculture, should we also consider state waters as areas for future AOAs?
Without question, state waters should absolutely be considered for future development of AOAs. There is a steadily growing interest in the offshore aquaculture sector from both current and potentially new producers and entrepreneurs. This interest is not only for food production, but also for markets like biofuels, bioplastics, bait fish, ornamentals and restorative and regenerative aquaculture for environmental remediation and climate change mitigation. These production systems do not require the same water depths as the large food fish pens being focused on for federal water AOAs nor do they pose the same siting and management complexities. While our experience and comments are specific to Florida, we believe that the opportunities presented by developing offshore aquaculture apply for states throughout the Gulf of Mexico.
In Florida, there is a wealth of regulatory and policy experience among various state agencies as well as vast coastal infrastructure, a world-renowned research, technology and innovation community and generations of collective experience working in the seafood, aquaculture, agriculture and maritime industries. As noted above, the State of Florida has already been working with NCCOS on a spatial siting analysis for offshore aquaculture in state waters and is preparing to begin complementary social science research with coastal stakeholders.
Siting AOAs in state waters would present a tremendous opportunity for Florida to enhance its workforce, drive technology and innovation and strengthen coastal economies. Notably, some of the most economically-depressed communities in Florida - those that have been disproportionately impacted by multiple recent disasters, including Hurricanes Michael and Sally and the COVID-19 pandemic - are precisely the same communities that have traditionally driven their economies through coastal and ocean tourism, fishing, working waterfronts and other maritime businesses. Developing offshore aquaculture does not need to be at the expense of existing fishers and fishing businesses; on the contrary, aquaculture presents an opportunity to diversify income and thus make businesses and coastal economies stronger and more resilient. Providing federal resources through the creation and support of AOAs in Florida state waters will help provide new economic opportunity in these communities.

Full text: Nov. 29With the consumption needs of an increasing world population putting greater stresses on environmental sustainability, there is a challenge of how to balance demand with supply.
Fishing experts project global aquaculture production will need to more than double in the next 40 years to feed the close to 10 billion people by the year 2050.
These same experts say there are many threats to fishing from the ocean, including overfishing that has reduced fish populations in some cases to the point of extinction. Industrialization has led to heavy metals pollution of the oceans. Plastic breakdown has infested marine life with micro-plastics.
The challenging scenario is one Pure Blue Fish U.S. founder and Chief Executive Officer Nimrod Litvak is addressing head-on and a key focus on the solution will be based in Orangeburg County.
Creating
an (aqua) culture
Litvak founded Pure Blue Fish, a fish farming company, about four years ago in Tel Aviv, Israel, to grow yellowtail fish.
The raising and eventual harvesting of the fish include recirculating aquaculture systems with zero-water discharge technology. The technology reduces water costs and pollution.
Last month, Litvak announced the company will invest $28.1 million to open its flagship U.S. operation in Orangeburg County at the John W. Matthews Jr. Industrial Park. The company will create 82 new jobs.
"Unlike most intensive aquaculture systems, our technology treats the water with biological and microbiological subsystems that enable our system to function at top efficiency without discharging polluted water, or any water, to the environment," Litvak said.
The Blue Fish system Pure Blue's Zero-Water Discharge Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) Technology was developed by Professor Jaap van Rijn of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.
RAS is a touted as a new way to farm fish in a safe, productive and sustainable way.
Instead of the traditional method of growing fish outdoors, this system raises fish at high densities in a "controlled" environment typically indoors.
The technology allows farmers to control environmental conditions year-round.
The technology removes the fish waste through converting ammonia to nitrate, converting nitrate to nitrogen gas, which evaporates; and converting organic-rich sludge and fish waste to a gaseous phase.
The processes provide a healthy environment for freshwater and saltwater aquaculture and minimize the discharge of waste.
The zero-water discharge RAS also treats the water circulating in the system by biotech and micro biotech technologies, according to the company.
This helps to save high costs of water and the cost of treating water going in; prevents polluting water from going out to the environment, and allows fish aquaculture to prosper on land away from oceans and lakes, Litvak said.
Pure Blue touts the RAS system as:
 Being suitable for a wide range of fish species.
 Providing optimal growing conditions to speed up production.
 Providing a clean, no hormones, fresh and healthy fish.
 Helping reduce exposure to diseases, due to unique growing methods.
There are challenges that include high initial capital investment, the need to capture a market and the need to build a brand name.
The Orangeburg project
In Orangeburg, Blue Fish will build a facility that will be 50,000 to 100,000 square feet at the John Matthews Industrial Park on about 30 acres.
The interior of the building is currently in the design phase. It is expected to be completed by 2022. It will be privately funded and owned by the company.
The company will raise the yellowtail fish from fingerling to the nursery stage, where the fish will stay a period of two months and grow under close observation.
The fish then enter into the grow-out phase of about one year where they reach a size of about four pounds. The fish then go into the final stage of harvesting, sorting by size and packaging.
The fish will go fresh to the market in eight hours, according to Blue Fish.
There will be about 18,500 fingerlings in each production cycle and six productions a year, according to the company.
Pure Blue Fish's South Carolina operations will serve as a production and packaging facility for distribution to the restaurant market.
The plant will start with annual production capacity of 150-200 tons of fish a year and 11-16 employees. It will operate around the clock. The initial output is expected nine months after the plant is operational.
A packing/processing house will be built to serve the fish plant after the farm reaches 600 tons of annual production.
Eventually, the production facility plans to produce 3,000 tons of fish a year.
Yellowfish
Yellowtail is a species of sturdy ocean fish in the jack family.
The fish is typically harvested wild off the coast of central Japan, southern California and Baja, California, and farmed in Mexico and Australia, according to the company.
The fish is mostly eaten as sushi or sashimi in fine Japanese restaurants, or grilled and served widely in other cuisines. In retail shops and supermarkets, the whole fish is sold, as well as fillets.
Meeting demand
Litvak notes the demand for fish is there.
Citing researchers from Florida Atlantic University, Litvak says the United States was the fifth largest seafood consumer in the world in 2015 and ranked third in wild-caught volume.
FAU researchers also say the Unites States is the largest importer of seafood products in the world. In 2017 alone, about 5.9 billion pounds of seafood were consumed with more than 50% of seafood consumed coming from aquaculture.
Less than 1% is produced in the U.S.
Orangeburg County
seen as big catch
Litvak says the project is a win-win in that it provides the county a locally grown fish by a local workforce for local consumption. The county will also become a production and distribution center and will offer a healthy food option.
Litvak cites the Orangeburg area as a suitable location with the needed infrastructure and economical utility rates. The company also cited the available training for company employees and attractive manufacturing incentives.
The average wage at the Orangeburg plant is expected to be between $18 and $25 an hour. Orangeburg County's average manufacturing wage is $15 an hour.
Orangeburg lures
Blue Fish
The company is receiving traditional incentives such as fee-in-lieu of taxes and a state grant for road infrastructure improvements.
The Coordinating Council for Economic Development has also approved job-development credits related to the project.
The company looked throughout the Southeast from Virginia down to Florida, but chose Orangeburg due to its logistics, pro-business environment and technical employee skill sets.
Blue Fish is the 22nd international company to call Orangeburg County home.

Full text: Targeted News Service
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 -- Eric Schwaab, senior vice president for oceans and ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, and Margaret Spring, chief conservation and science officer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, California, has issued a public comment on the Corps of Engineers proposed rule entitled "Proposal To Reissue and Modify Nationwide Permits". The comment was written on Nov. 16, 2020, and posted on Nov. 17, 2020:
* * *
On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, we write to comment on three proposed nationwide permits (NWP): the proposed NWP B for Finfish Mariculture Activities, the proposed renewal of NWP 48 for Commercial Shellfish Mariculture Activities, and proposed NWP A for Seaweed Mariculture Activities. While we support sustainable aquaculture in U.S. waters, NWP B is not appropriate to cover such a broad range of finfish activities that, in many cases, pose significant risks of environmental impacts. Given this diversity of activities and potential impacts, we are unable to propose appropriate limitations for NWP B. We urge the Administration to withdraw and reconsider NWP B and include additional opportunities for input from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in siting potential offshore aquaculture facilities. Nationwide permits may be suitable to regulate shellfish and kelp aquaculture if the production systems, impacts and best practices are well known and enforced. However, as proposed, NWP 48 and NWP A lack sufficient scientific justification and conditions for protections related to eelgrass, native species and cumulative impacts. These proposed nationwide permits should be revised with additional scientific justification, appropriate conditions and best practices and recirculated for public comment.
In significant respects, the challenge of permitting finfish aquaculture activities in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) stems from the lack of a clear governance structure for this emerging use. NWP B does not have legal standards to prevent the full suite of potential environmental impacts, including escapes, siting, feed, sustainability, and other issues specific to finfish aquaculture. We believe that working to establish consensus around the appropriate standards, including pursuing more robust siting and additional research to answer open questions, would be a more durable approach that could meet the dual objectives of finfish aquaculture development and environmental protection. Further, reliance upon public comments to propose limitations on the three aquaculture NWPs is not an appropriate strategy to alleviate the current regulatory uncertainty and lack of financing that has significantly limited U.S. aquaculture development. Ultimately, U.S. offshore aquaculture requires a new comprehensive legal framework based on science, transparency and stakeholder engagement.
As a legal matter, nationwide permits are intended for activities similar in nature that cause minimal environmental effects./1
As described in further detail below, NWP B could permit activities of very different types in vastly different areas with potentially significant environmental impacts. And given the wide range of activities that could be authorized and the emerging state of the science and management of offshore finfish aquaculture, we are unable to provide meaningful terms and conditions that might address their environmental impacts. Absent a comprehensive framework, permitting finfish aquaculture undertaken on an individual, project specific basis that takes into account details about siting, structure, species, operations, and environmental conditions is necessary to ensure that aquaculture facilities do not pose unacceptable risks to safety and the environment. NWP A and NWP 48 can be addressed through providing more specific conditions and best practices in the proposed NWPs to address potential impacts on marine resources.
I. Finfish Mariculture Projects Are Not an Appropriate Subject of NWPs
NWPs are appropriate where the activities authorized "are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment."/2
These parameters are critical, given that NWPs eliminate significant public participation through avoiding project-specific public notice requirements, NEPA compliance, and adoption of mitigation measures. They are intended to be used in cases where the Corps determines that the NWP itself provides sufficient information regarding the regulated activity for the public to understand the extent of the regulated activity and the associated environmental effects. Proposed NWP B fails to meet these standards.
A. All finfish mariculture activities are not similar in nature
As the Corps recognizes in its proposed rule, "[t]he impacts of mariculture activities on the environment are strongly influenced by how they are operated, including which species are being produced, stocking density, how the fish are being fed, and location."/3
Finfish mariculture activities are not similar in nature, particularly with respect to offshore farms. Offshore finfish farms are more exposed to wind and waves, and therefore usually require advanced technology to operate./4
While the challenges of anchoring and operating at sea are common to all offshore and coastal mariculture projects, the solutions to these challenges may be very different.
Offshore aquaculture projects may require any of the following: (i) heavy-duty moorings in deep sea water; (ii) offshore systems for the containment of aquatic crops; (iii) sea-going work boats fully equipped with cranes and crop harvesting and handling equipment; (iv) offshore feed storage and feed distribution systems; (v) automatic or partly automated feeding systems; (vi) mechanization of husbandry and maintenance tasks; (vii) remote monitoring and control systems; and (viii) increased production size to generate economies of scale./5
A wide range of designs and concepts have been developed for finfish mariculture to allow the practice to adapt to challenging ocean conditions. A number of these design concepts evolved out of offshore oil and gas rig designs./6
These include bottom-supported platforms, jack-up rigs and monopods, floating and semi-submersible platforms, including conventional ships and barges, as well as net pens supported between moored spar buoys./7
Frequently, offshore fish cages will be enclosed and completely submerged to avoid the wave stress placed on floating structures./8
Currently, a variety of submersible and semi-submersible sea cages exist on the market./9
This diversity is not limited to the types of structures employed, but also the species proposed to be cultivated. The draft NWP lists at least nine species that could be cultivated/10 and there is no limitation or restriction on what or where species can be cultivated, leaving open the option that finfish species that are not native to an area could be introduced. The draft decision document acknowledges this variability as well, noting that "alterations will vary, depending on the specific characteristics of the specific activity authorized by this NWP and the environmental setting in which the NWP activity may occur. The environmental setting will vary from site to site, and from region to region across the country."/11
The variety of designs, systems, and species available for finfish mariculture, combined with the need to adapt each system to unique regional and local environmental conditions, guarantees that each project will be substantially different than the next. The variety of finfish mariculture projects precludes these installations from being authorized under a NWP.
B. Finfish mariculture activities are likely to have greater than minimal adverse environmental impacts
The proposed rule does not provide sufficient information and analysis to conclude that all finfish aquaculture projects authorized under NWP B would result in minimal adverse environmental effects. If "the effect of a general permit will be more than minimal, either individually or cumulatively, the Corps cannot issue the permit."/12
Given that the proposed NWP would authorize very large facilities holding various types of species throughout the largest EEZ in the world,/13 it cannot meet this requirement.
Finfish mariculture projects, like certain commercial fishing gear, can present a serious risk of entangling or injuring marine mammals and other wildlife. At particular risk are large whales, including the endangered North Atlantic right whale/14 and Humpback whale./15
The risk presented to marine mammals cannot be properly evaluated or mitigated when the NWP would authorize finfish mariculture projects that could take place anywhere in an extremely large area and could have any number of operational components. The draft decision document acknowledges this potential issue, but takes no steps to avoid or mitigate potential impacts to marine mammals or other wildlife./16
Likewise, finfish aquaculture farms authorized under the NWP could result in significant cumulative impacts on marine wildlife and the environment. The failure of aquaculture equipment and gear can result in the release of cultivated, potentially non-native fish, which risks significant impacts through cross-breeding with native species, genetic mutation, disease proliferation, and new predation patterns./17
These impacts cannot be properly assessed and mitigated because the Corps simply lacks the information necessary to make an informed decision on those impacts on a nationwide basis./18
While the draft NWP acknowledges that "[s]patial planning for mariculture activities in federal waters . . . can be an important tool for siting these facilities to manage impacts on the aquatic environment,"/19 the NWP does not provide for such planning and would eliminate project-specific public notice and comment that would facilitate responsible site selection.
The proposed rule asserts that these issues can be addressed for individual applications through review by district engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit./20
However, in Coalition to Protect Puget Sound Habitat v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,/21 the court invalidated an NWP that relied on similar reasoning:
The problems here are that the Corps' minimal impact determinations were entirely conclusory and the regional conditions that it assumed would minimize impacts were not in place at the time NWP 48 was adopted. The record is devoid of any indication that the Corps considered regional data, catalogued the species in and characteristics of the aquatic environments in which commercial shellfish aquaculture activities occur, considered the myriad techniques, equipment, and materials used in shellfish aquaculture, attempted to quantify the impacts the permitted activity would likely have on the identified species and characteristics, or evaluated the impacts of the as-yet-unknown regional conditions. Faced with incredible diversity in both the environment and the activities permitted under NWP 48, the Corps effectively threw up its hands and turned the impact analyses over to the district engineers . . . This abdication of responsibility is not authorized under the CWA or NEPA./22
Pursuant to this decision, the Corps has the obligation to analyze and quantify the adverse impacts of its proposed permit and cannot defer that analysis to individual district engineers or another agency./23
C. The Decision Document does not satisfy NEPA
The Decision Document relies on an environmental assessment (EA) to meet NEPA requirements, but the proposed action of allowing for widespread aquaculture may significantly affect the quality of the human environment,/24 necessitating an environmental impact statement (EIS).
Indeed, the draft decision document appears to acknowledge that an EIS is required, noting that there "may be unavoidable environmental risks associated with finfish mariculture activities,"/25 which triggers preparation of an EIS under NEPA. It further states that finfish mariculture activities "may cause physical, chemical, and biological changes to marine and estuarine waters,"/26 indicating that an analysis of alternatives including permit limitations, conditions, or mitigation measures to address these effects would be necessary as part of an EIS.
The Decision Document acknowledges:
Since there is considerable variation across the country in terms of the types of aquatic resources, the ecological functions and services they provide, and their resilience and resistances to disturbances caused by NWP activities, other human activities, and natural disturbances, the environmental consequences of the issuance of this NWP will vary by site and by region. Given the geographic scope in which this NWP can be used to authorize activities that require [Corps] authorization and the wide variability in aquatic resource structure, functions, and dynamics from site to site and from region to region, there are also considerable challenges in characterizing the potential environmental consequences of the issuance of this NWP at a national scale./27
Such variability makes a proper evaluation of environmental impacts impossible in an EA, which is limited to "briefly provid[ing] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement" and "briefly discuss[ing] the purpose and need for the proposed action, alternatives... and the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives."/28
While the Decision Document attempts to address this problem by generally noting that structures and works in navigable waters may alter ecological functions, deferring site-specific analysis to district engineers was recently ruled to be insufficient./29
Similarly, the Corps' impact analysis disclaims any responsibility for environmental review of "activities that do not require [Corps] authorization, such as the addition or removal of finfish from the cages or net pens, feeding activities, the administration of antibiotics and other therapeutics to keep the cultivated finfish healthy, the use of chemicals to control sea lice and other parasites, and the use of antifouling agents."/30
But these impacts are the direct result of the permit being issued and must be examined./31
The Corps further notes that "[f]or the national-scale analysis of the potential environmental consequences presented in this section, it is not possible to quantify the relative contributions of the various activities."/32
However, "general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided."/33
For example, as discussed above finfish escapement can be a significant risk of offshore aquaculture./34
While the Decision Document notes that serious issues can arise through improper installation and maintenance of the aquaculture gear approved by the Corps, it does not analyze the risks nor alternatives that would include robust inspections and enforcement as required by NEPA, instead appearing to rely upon the hope that "project proponents are responsible for designing and properly maintaining their finfish mariculture facilities, which should help reduce the potential for escapes."/35
While the Corps may not have the authority to regulate finfish escapes,/36 it can require that structures installed in navigable waters are properly designed and maintained to prevent them./37
An analysis of the identified environmental risks is necessary.
Similarly, the Decision Document notes that "Cultivating finfish species in ocean waters outside their native ecoregions should be considered a high risk activity that could potentially have substantial adverse ecological and socio-economic outcomes;"/38 finfish have low genetic diversity and interbreeding between wild and captive fish can reduce the ability of those species to survive; and describes additional environmental risks posed by finfish mariculture, but does not analyze the risks described./39
This level of general description, without an analysis of the potential effects or impacts, does not comply with NEPA./40
As noted above, rather than performing the detailed level of environmental review required by NEPA, the Corps proposes to have district engineers undertake the required environmental evaluation./41
While tiering review and decision-making is permissible under NEPA, there must first exist a national decision document that evaluates the impacts of the proposed activity in light of any regional conditions imposed to tier from./42
The Decision Document fails to undertake that analysis. Instead, cumulative analysis is limited to two NEPA assessments - one at national scale and one at a regional scale. It is unlikely that these NEPA assessments can capture the full suite of cumulative impacts without more specific species and operational information. The District Engineer has the authority to assess and approve permits based on these NEPA analyses in a decision document. It is unclear how the NWP will assess cumulative impacts without any standards in place.
The lack of analysis in the NWP is of particular concern because the NWP process itself has very little public engagement and transparency. The NWP is designed to minimize federal review (including NEPA) and fast-track permitting - the applicant is approved as long as they meet NWP regional requirements and pre-construction notifications, nearly all of which are within the discretion of the District Engineer.
II. The Permitted Activities Are Too Variable and Uncertain for the Public to Recommend Limitations
In this proposed rule, the Corps has requested that the public recommend limits to the scope of the proposed NWPs, such that use of the procedure would be appropriate./43
The Corps often solicits such information and then issues the final NWP with those qualifications it finds necessary./44
Unfortunately, here the scope of activities that could take place under all three NWPs is so broad that we cannot suggest such limitations at this time. For example, potential impacts could vary depending on the type of structure used and where they are located; what may be workable in the Gulf of Mexico might not be sufficient dozens of miles from the coast of Guam or Alaska. The scope of the NWPs is so broad that it is impossible to provide practical and appropriate parameters for siting, control of escapes, and other issues, without a much more specific and robust discussion of limiting conditions and standards in the proposed NWPs.
III. If the Corps Intends to Limit the NWPs, the APA Requires Reproposing the Action
Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the public is entitled to notice and the opportunity to comment on information that is central to an agency's decision./45
This process provides for the "robust debate of competing and frequently complicated policy considerations having far-reaching implications,"/46 such as approving finfish aquaculture facilities for all waters of the United States.
The draft NWPs lack information necessary for informed public comment such as the types of structures that will be authorized, the species that may be cultivated, what limitations may be placed on finfish and kelp operations, as well as discussion of potential environmental effects or how any such effects may be mitigated. As such, they do not contain sufficient information to inform public comment./47
In the event that the Corps chooses to apply limiting conditions to the NWPs, we ask that the agency repropose them so that the public has the opportunity to comment on the revised proposed NWPs.
IV. NOAA's Role is Unclear
Under the recent Executive Order 13921, Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth,/48 NOAA was designated the lead agency for aquaculture projects located outside of the waters of any State or Territory and within the EEZ, recognizing the important role that NOAA plays in managing marine resources./49
While the Corps currently consults with NOAA under the Endangered Species Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and Marine Mammal Protection Act, this consultation is limited to specific considerations of impacts to endangered and threatened species, commercial fisheries, and marine mammals. While NOAA has a significant amount of expertise in these areas, it also can provide valuable guidance in site selection, and navigating potential conflicts between aquaculture projects, marine resources, other ocean users, and wild-capture fisheries. The proposed nationwide mariculture permits provide no role for NOAA in these efforts. The Corps would benefit from NOAA's scientific expertise on species selection, farming methods and other technical considerations necessary for evaluation of applicants or monitoring of operations.
NOAA is the appropriate agency to provide this expertise in reviewing and assigning specific permit terms.
V. Conclusion
We support responsible and environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Therefore, while we believe the NWP approach is inappropriate for finfish aquaculture, we stand ready to work with the Corps, NOAA, the industry, wild-capture fishermen, environmentalists, and others to help develop science-based regulatory standards that will allow for offshore aquaculture to add jobs and provide sustainable seafood to our nation while protecting the marine environment and existing uses. We also respectfully request that the Corps to incorporate specific conditions and best practices for NWP 48 and NWP A to protect marine resources and the environment, which should be recirculated for public review and comment.

Mariculture versus Aquaculture
We appreciate the effort by the Corps to distinguish the culture location through the use of the archaic term "mariculture." We respectfully suggest that the Corps follow the lead of the National Aquaculture Policy Act of 1980 and add modifying terms to "aquaculture" to create improved specificity. Examples could be "freshwater," "marine," "coastal marine," or "offshore." Relative to the NWPs, we suggest dropping the term "activity" since aquaculture is a farming practice and adopting the terms Marine Shellfish Aquaculture, Seaweed Aquaculture (seaweeds are marine plants; there is no need to be redundant) and Offshore Marine Finfish Aquaculture to define the activity and where it may occur.
Nationwide Permit 48, Shellfish Aquaculture
The East Coast Shellfish Growers Association and the Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association have thoroughly reviewed the proposed revisions to this nationwide permit. We support their request that primary literature should be cited to support your decision making for potential impacts related to production practices, production gear, submerged aquatic vegetation and mechanical harvest. We request that their references and analysis be accepted and incorporated into the final rule where appropriate. We also recommend that an agency information exchange occur with Pacific Shellfish Institute, NOAA Science Centers and state Sea Grant or Land Grant Programs such as Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi-Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington that have researched and/or published papers describing potential environmental effects and how to mitigate those effects. A summary analysis of these efforts for the period 1970-2018 is posted here: http://masgc.org/assets/uploads/publications/1718/19-092.pdf.
The context in which shellfish are farmed in the United States is important when considering environmental effects. The 22 coastal states lease submerged marine lands for shellfish under the rubric of the public trust doctrine. Fundamentally, farms are required to maintain public resources held in trust by the states and return benefits for the use in the form of rent or farm-raised shellfish for human consumption (O'Connell 2018). We recommend recognizing this fundamental tenet of governance that while outside the Corps' authority is a significant societal action by each coastal state to protect the marine environment.
We believe the sentence in the proposed revision, "Commercial shellfish mariculture operations may use chemicals to control fouling organisms" is incorrect. Chemical use or the potential introduction of toxic chemicals is regulated by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference directly related to the waters in which shellfish are farmed and harvested, shellfish farming practices and beyond the farm gate in the human food supply chain by the Food and Drug Administration.
The Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, a federal/state cooperative program recognized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, is focused on promoting and improving the sanitation of farmed and wild harvested shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels and scallops) moving in interstate commerce through federal/state cooperation and uniformity of State shellfish programs. All coastal states that farm or wild-harvest shellfish for human consumption are members and implement in state regulations the Guide for the Control of Molluscan Shellfish. Inherent to the Guide are provisions to prevent the introduction of toxic chemicals to shellfish intended for human consumption.
Beyond the farmgate, shellfish processors must implement Food and Drug Administration, Seafood HACCP. The program requires an analysis for potential hazards in shellfish for human consumption that includes Chapter 9, Environmental Chemical Contaminants and Pesticides (FDA 2020). Seafood processors, including shellfish, must assess and, in some cases test, the products that receive from the farmer or wild-harvest for identified chemicals and develop critical control points that will trigger controls to prevent hazardous chemicals from entering the human seafood market chain.
We recommend that the Corps recognize as normal farming practices the methods utilized to harvest shellfish through mechanical means (i.e., power rakes, hydraulic rakes, scrapes, suction harvesters, etc.) as provided in 33 CFR Sec. 323.2(d)(3)(iii) (Creswell and McNevin 2008). The function of these mechanical harvesters is to replace the use of hand tools and to separate farmed bivalve shellfish from benthic sediments. In all cases farmers do not wish to displace or remove sediment as this material will serve as the planting bed for future production. In essence the sediments are exempted "incidental fall back" materials. Only shellfish or their valves are removed 33 CFR Sec. 323.2(d)(1) (Stokesbury et al. 2011).
Nationwide Permit A, Seaweed Aquaculture
We support the creation of a nationwide permit for seaweed aquaculture. Seaweed farming has a relatively short US history and the foresight of the Corps to propose a nationwide permit that includes all of US marine waters is a welcomed development (Kim et al. 2019). Seaweed aquaculture as practiced in the United States does not result in the discharge of dredged and fill materials. Seaweed production is entirely passive. Young plants are "seeded" to anchored and suspended ropes for grow-out. Growing plants derive nutrients from the water column and farmers periodically visit farm sites to untangle lines and check mooring anchor number and condition (Flavin et al. 2013: Redmond et al. 2014; Freitag 2017). We disagree with the statement in the notice that "seaweed mariculture activities may alter estuarine and marine habitats utilized by endangered or threatened species." The production gear and passive growth of native marine plants improves water quality (Kim et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2017), provides ecosystem services (Froelich et al. 2019; Theuerkauf et al. 2019) and creates refuge and a potential source of food through the mobile and encrusting animals associated with the farms. We recommend that if District Engineers have questions about seaweed aquaculture to utilize a National Sea Grant Program Seaweed Hub as a source of information and expertise. In addition, we offer our assistance to organize farm tours for the US Army Corps of Engineers of active operations.
Nationwide Permit B, Marine Finfish Aquaculture
We support the creation of a nationwide permit for finfish aquaculture in coastal and oceanic waters and note that the Corps is currently in a permitting process for a Florida Sea Grant Program funded experimental and demonstration sea cage farm in the Gulf of Mexico.
We disagree with the statement in the notice that "finfish mariculture activities may alter estuarine and marine habitats utilized by endangered or threatened species." The federal permitting process for offshore farms requires interagency consultations, as authorized by the National Environmental Policy Act, to enforce the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to prevent injury or death to listed species, marine mammals and birds and to prohibit unpermitted fishery harvest, possession or sale. Price and Morris (2013) evaluated entanglements across the globe and summarized:
"At modern fish farms, impacts to predatory sharks and marine mammals are being minimized with improved net technologies and removal of dead fish from cages to prevent predation on cultured fish. Siting away from known aggregation sites and installing rigid predator exclusion nets are effective at preventing negative impacts to cultured fish, farm structures and marine predators. Acoustic deterrent devices are not consistently useful against sea lions and seals and may have deleterious impacts to non-target marine mammals. In the U.S., nonlethal interventions to prevent marine mammal predation are preferred.2 At marine fish farms, entanglement in the farm structures may pose a slight threat to sea turtles, dolphins, whales and seabirds. Keeping lines taut and the water free of debris are effective at minimizing or eliminating conflict with marine mammals and turtles (page iv)."
Unlike fishing gear that is designed to intentionally "catch" animals, aquaculture gear is designed contain animals being cultured without hurting them or any wild animals that may occur around farms. A second in-depth analysis summarized interactions by at-risk sea turtles, sea birds, sharks and marine mammals with aquaculture production gear to inform the federal permitting process (Price et al. 2017). The goal of the assessment was to strengthen the ability of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other regulatory agencies to make science-based decisions and recommendations as part of the review and consultation process required by the National Environmental Policy Act to permit nearshore and offshore aquaculture operations.
The authors found few at-risk species and aquaculture production gear interactions. As a surrogate they examined analogous fishery gear and then suggested preventative measures to include farm siting to avoid migration routes and resting, feeding and breeding habitats; farm worker training to avoid feeding or harassing visiting animals; properly tensioned lines; installation and maintenance of predation prevention nets; and similar commonsense practices (pages 57-58).
In addition, individuals and companies interested in siting a farm can avail themselves of publicly available farm siting tools to avoid conflict, or impact on, at-risk species and critical habitat. The NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science posts 83 aquaculture mapping and informational publications to the Coastal Aquaculture Planning Portal. The siting tools posted to the Portal can be state-specific (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington), regional (Gulf of Mexico, Northwest Pacific, Southeast United States, mid-Atlantic) or habitat (essential fish habitat, marine protected areas, estuaries) oriented. Belle and Nash (2008) summarized the challenges associated with siting farms in the dynamic oceanic environment, noted environmental benefits and suggested site assessment criteria. The Belle and Nash reported:
"The health, welfare, and quality of the aquatic animals produced in net pens are directing impacted by the quality of water surrounding and flowing through pens. Importantly, producers using net pens have little ability to protect their animals from degraded water quality and other environmental influences. Thus, any effect that management practices have on water quality or the local environment also directly impacts culture animal performance and farm economic returns. The intimate linkage between environmental quality, cultured animal performance, and farm profits provides incentives for producers to manage operations in harmony with the local environment (page 261)."
And
"Net pens crate new underwater structures in local environments. These structures and their associated mooring systems provide three-dimensional habitat similar to engineered artificial reefs. Net-pen facilities can increase the total amount of habitat available and habitat complexity. Structures, such as pens and their associated anchoring systems, preclude access by trawlers to benthic ecosystems under and around farms. These ecosystems are therefore protected from the physical damage associated with destructive fishing practices (page 261)."
Benetti et al. (2010) provided a succinct set of farm site selection criteria and the rationale for each that addressed environmental (physical and biological), socio-economic and practical issues.
Marine finfish farms operate in dynamic environments where no one farm will be like another because of the variety of production gear used, farm size and disposition and seasonally changing climatic and oceanic conditions. We offer our assistance to organize farm design, siting and operation workshops and farm tours for the US Army Corps of Engineers of active operations.
Sincerely,
Jim Parsons

Full text: The Center for Food Safety issued the following news release:
On Friday, Center for Food Safety, the Don't Cage Our Ocean Coalition, and allies filed an appeal against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) pollution discharge permit for Velella Epsilon, an industrial finfish aquaculture facility vying for construction permits in federal waters off of Sarasota, Florida. The EPA's permit will allow the facility to dump untreated wastewater directly into the surrounding ecosystems.
Groups filing the appeal, which include Center for Food Safety, Recirculating Farms Coalition, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Food & Water Watch, Healthy Gulf, Suncoast Waterkeeper, and Tampa Bay Waterkeeper, argue that the permit violates the Clean Water Act (CWA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The organizations released the following statement today:
"This permit should never have been issued. The EPA violated the law by failing to evaluate the potential dangers of the wastewater that this facility will release, such as contributing to harmful algal blooms (also often known as red tide) and pharmaceutical residues in the ocean and antibiotic resistance in people. By allowing this facility to pollute, the EPA has failed to protect the vulnerable Gulf ecosystem and the communities that rely on it. This needs to stop."

Full text: The federal government has opened a public comment period for offshore fish farming locations with an area in the Gulf of Mexico proposed as one of the first U.S. aquaculture sites.
Offshore aquaculture has been a contentious issue in Southwest Florida as environmental groups worry these facilities add excess nutrients into the ocean.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is holding three listening sessions in concurrence with the 60-day comment period to help the public understand the process.
"NOAA will use best available science combined with stakeholder input when identifying Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs)," Roy Crabtree, NOAA Fisheries regional administrator, wrote in an email. "The goal is to identify areas that are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. This proactive approach has been refined and utilized widely within states and by other countries."
Following President Donald Trump's executive order in May mandating NOAA identify two areas in federal waters within a year, the agency opened the public comment window Oct. 23.
NOAA is considering the Gulf of Mexico and waters off the coast of Southern California for its first two Aquaculture Opportunity Areas. There is "current industry interest" as well as existing relevant data in these two regions, according to documents filed in the Federal Register.
Once identified and approved, these localized opportunity areas will provide companies the ability to produce offshore fish farming facilities outside of state waters. There currently are no such areas in U.S. waters.
Once the agency has solidified the two areas for offshore fish farms, it has two years to complete a report detailing any effects an aquaculture facility would have. NOAA must then identify two additional areas every four years to keep up with the president's executive order.
"The areas identified as AOAs will have characteristics that are expected to be able to support multiple aquaculture farm sites of varying types, but all portions of the AOA may not be appropriate for aquaculture or for all types of aquaculture," the document says.
Various Florida political leaders have supported offshore aquaculture in the Gulf, including Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, a Democrat, and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican.
Rubio was a cosponsor of the AQUAA Act, which he said would streamline the rules for aquaculture and promote its responsible and safe success.
"In June, I urged the Administration to designate waters near Florida as one of the first aquaculture opportunity areas," Rubio said in a statement. "I'm pleased that NOAA has since decided that the Gulf of Mexico will have one of the first of these areas. The public comment period is an important opportunity for Florida's wealth of expertise to make itself heard about why Florida, and its 1,350 miles of coastline, is uniquely situated for this designation."
Ocean Era, a Hawai'i-based aquaculture company, is working to obtain permits for what it calls a pilot program about 45 miles off the Sarasota coast. The project, Velella Epsilon, will hold about 20,000 almaco jack in net pens.
Potential land-based alternatives Fish farming in federal waters does have some groups worried, however, and efforts have been rolled back in other countries with previous offshore programs.
Marianne Cufone, founder and executive director of Recirculating Farms Coalition, said there are more sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives to offshore farms. Cufone operates a land-based fish farm in New Orleans.
Cufone has been part the group advocating for alternatives to offshore fish farms since around 2008 when the federal government previously tried to develop offshore aquaculture.
"If we really wanted to build a sustainable seafood culture in the U.S. in addition to wild capture, we thought that land-based recirculating farming was a good alternative," she said.
These recirculating farms can grow a variety of seafood as well as hydroponic plants, she said. The water in these types of farms is recycled and reused, creating what Cufone said was a highly efficient and eco-friendly way to produce seafood.
"We avoid a lot of the risks that are a concerned with offshore farming," she said. "Fish won't escape, we're not using public space for private profit nor do we need runoff solutions for the farms because it's a mostly contained system."
Providing public input While NOAA isn't seeking input on alternatives to offshore aquaculture, there are 12 topics members of the public can address ranging from questions about the types of fish in offshore farms, overlapping areas of protected species habitat and areas to be avoided because of harmful algal blooms. A full list can be found in the Federal Register.
After the public comment period, NOAA's next steps will be to develop areas based on the comments, spatial analysis and interagency discussion, Crabtree wrote. Identifying these areas is a planning process and will not change any current state or federal permitting processes.
"NOAA intends to seek additional public input on these possible AOAs through the programmatic National Environmental Policy Act process that will begin in May 2021," he wrote.
The administration is holding two national listening sessions and one specifically about the Gulf of Mexico. The webinars can be accessed on NOAA's website. The session for the Gulf of Mexico AOA will take place Nov. 17 from 1-3 p.m.
Members of the public who want to submit comments must do so by Dec.22.
"Designating Florida's waters as one of the first aquaculture opportunity areas would be a positive step towards pursuing a more resilient domestic food supply chain," Rubio said in the statement.

Full text: SARASOTA – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will extend its public notice and comment period on a construction permit for the first finfish farm ever authorized in federal waters.
The comment deadline, originally set for Nov. 4, was extended because the agency's email was not working, and comments previously submitted were not received. The new deadline is Nov. 19.
The Corps, which previously had not committed to accept public comment on the project, changed course after local community members expressed strong concerns about Hawaii-based Ocean Era's offshore demonstration farm.
The project would raise 20,000 almaco jack, a species common to the Gulf of Mexico, in an anchored chain-link mesh pen 45 miles southwest of Longboat Pass off Sarasota County.
The project – dubbed Velella Epsilon – needs the construction permit from the Corps before it can proceed. Environmental groups are challenging a recent decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to grant a pollutant discharge permit for the project.
Opponents say offshore fish farms will create pollution from fish waste, spread diseases to wild fish populations and increase competition with fishing companies that depend on wild catches. Opponents also have argued that anchoring fish pens in the hurricane-active Gulf will open the door to a host of problems.
Ocean Era, formally known as Kampachi Farms, is asking the Corps to authorize a small, pilot-scale finfish farm that would temporarily anchor a marine aquaculture system. That includes a tender support vessel, an offshore copper mesh pen and three-ton drag embedded anchors that would be deployed for 12-18 months.
The net pen is designed to self-adjust to suit the changing wave and current conditions of the Gulf. When a storm approaches the area, for example, a valve would be opened to flood the system with water, causing the entire net pen array to submerge but be maintained several meters above the sea floor and still be able to rotate and adjust to the currents.
People who previously sent comments to the OceanEra_VEAquaculture@usace.army.mil email are asked by the Corps to resend those comments as soon as possible. They will receive an email response confirming receipt of their comments.

Offshore fish farm worse than an oil rig

Full text: I don't have the exact coordinates for the proposed fish farm for which Hawaii- based Ocean Era Corp. is seeking a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. But its reported location of "45 miles southwest of Sarasota" puts it smack dab in the middle of the red snapper and grouper grounds of recreational anglers in Southwest Florida and from all over the country.
Permitting this underwater monstrosity would be a tragedy.
A chain link cage, anchored to the sea floor 130 feet below, with 20,000 almaco jack fish packed like cattle, in an oversized bait ball of synthetic feed, waste, and pharmaceuticals, would alter the ecology and pollute and deform Florida's natural, heretofore, uncorrupted west coast.
That the Corps would contemplate a permit is befuddling, considering what they already know. A study published in Science Direct in December 2019, detailed the chronic accidents imperiling Norway's offshore fish farm industry, including "mass mortality of fish during and after operations, introgression of genes from farmed salmon, the spread of disease and material damage to assets..."
The conservation group Friends of the Earth echoed the same dangers: "From the release of untreated fish waste and excess nutrients to the overuse of antibiotics and endangerment of marine life, industrial ocean fish farms are nothing but bad news for our oceans."
Ocean Era itself acknowledged that in their other existing farm off Hawaii, which they saturate with hydrogen peroxide, "leakage" is common and escape risk "high" for the penned fish invariably infected with "skin fluke parasites." They also acknowledge hazards for large fish and mammals (dolphins and whales) attracted to the cages that can become trapped inside and die, as happened recently with an endangered tiger shark and a monk seal.
Ocean Era states that aquaculture would make us less dependent on imported seafood. But a better option emerged in a report just last week that more humpback whales are being observed off the coast of New York than ever before, as they feed on massive schools of menhaden that have returned and propagated. Scientists say New York's bounty of forage is due to cleaner water and stricter conservation laws, which is what Florida's focus should be for increasing domestic fish stocks, instead of polluting the Gulf with farms to make inorganic "seafood."
As both a sportsman and a human being, I plead also on behalf of the caged fish. Fishermen respect nature and appreciate the intelligence, complexity, and intrinsic value of the Gulf's inhabitants. We marvel at the freedom, speed, and magnificence of the nearer dwelling native amberjack, to which the almaco jack is a close cousin which can grow to 80 pounds. It is an offshore pelagic, a silvery torpedo high in the food chain who prowls the open ocean for prey (not pellets) in depths of 800 to 1,000 feet.
But in Ocean Era's net pens, they are disabled from roaming, confined in a watery cell in a shallow and unaccustomed depth, leading an unnatural, immured existence before being slaughtered and frozen for shipment.
Finally, the allure of offshore sport fishing depends on the pristine character of the Gulf of Mexico. The sea is the last frontier where sportsmen, tourists, and native Floridians reliably encounter wilderness, solitude, and wonder.
Sailing over hills of sparkling blue water, accompanied by platoons of dolphin, frigate birds with 8 foot wingspan soaring overhead, flying fish gliding iridescent in your wake, and curious loggerheads surfacing to investigate, even the least spiritual among us suspect that this is where God, if he or she exists, would reside.
Imagine if you were vacationing in Yellowstone National Park, exhilarating in the mountains, the rivers, and the wildlife, and your path were suddenly blocked by a barbed wire corral imprisoning 20,000 cramped, sedentary bison. In many of the same ways, a 24/7 barge parked over a submerged fenced-in enclosure stabilized with floating, lighted buoys, and boiling with disoriented fish and a festering stew of contaminants, destroys our Gulf wilderness.
In jeopardizing our seascape and its cleanliness, the Ocean Era fish farm may pose an even more serious threat to Florida tourism, the state's No. 1 industry, than the grotesquely protruding and hugely dangerous oil rigs which the state has been successfully fending off its west coast for decades.
Denying Ocean Era a permit may seem like a no-brainer. But in view of the current federal administration's preference for private industry profits to trump environmental health, and the President's executive order just last May to remove federal restrictions on aquaculture, I urge readers to make their views known by sending comments to the Army Corp of Engineers using this email address: OceanEra_VEaquaculture@usace.army.mil before Nov. 4th.

Permitting this underwater monstrosity would be a tragedy.
The allure of offshore fishing depends on the pristine character of the Gulf of Mexico. The high seas comprise the last frontier where sportsmen, tourists, and native Floridians reliably encounter wilderness, solitude, and wonder.
The phenomenon of the ocean is that you can visit it every single day and it's never the same - always virgin water, replete with flora and fauna that can inspire and surprise. While sailing over hills of sparkling blue water, accompanied by platoons of dolphin, frigate birds with 8-foot wingspans soaring overhead, flying fish gliding iridescent in your wake and curious loggerheads surfacing to investigate, even an atheist suspects that this is where God, if he or she existed, would reside.

In many of the same ways, a 24-7 "support vessel" parked over a submerged fenced-in enclosure stabilized with floating buoys and boiling with disoriented fish and a festering stew of contaminants, destroys our Gulf wilderness.
That the Army Corps would even contemplate issuing a permit is befuddling, in consideration of the statistical and anecdotal data on fish farms already available. A study published in Science Directin December 2019 detailed the chronic accidents imperiling Norway's offshore fish farm industry, including "mass mortality of fish during and after operations, introgression of genes from farmed salmon, the spread of disease and material damage to assets..."
The conservation group Friends of the Earth echoed some of the same dangers: "From the release of untreated fish waste and excess nutrients to the overuse of antibiotics and endangerment of marine life, industrial ocean fish farms are nothing but bad news for our oceans."
And Ocean Era itself has acknowledged that in their only other existing offshore fish cage off the coast of Hawaii, which they saturate with thousands of gallons of hydrogen peroxide, "leakage" is common and escape risk is "high" for the penned fish invariably infected with "skin fluke parasites." They also admit to hazards for large fish and mammals (dolphins and whales) attracted to the cages that can become trapped inside and die, as happened recently with an endangered tiger shark and a monk seal.
As both a sportsman and a human being, I plead also in behalf of the caged fish. I am not a member or spokesperson for PETA. But I have a deep respect for nature and have come to appreciate the intelligence, complexity, and intrinsic value of the Gulf's inhabitants.
Denying Ocean Era a permit may seem like a no-brainer. But in view of the current federal administration's preference for private-industry profits to trump environmental health, and the president's executive order just last May to remove federal restrictions on aquaculture, I urge readers to make their views known by sending comments to the Army Corps of Engineers before Nov. 4.

Full text: SARASOTA – After mounting pressure from environmentalists, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced this week that it will hold a public notice and comment period on a construction permit for the first finfish farm ever authorized in federal waters.
The Corps, which had previously not committed to accept public comment on the project, changed course after local community members expressed strong concerns Hawaii-based Ocean Era's offshore demonstration farm.
The project would raise 20,000 almaco jack, a species common in the Gulf, in an anchored chain-link mesh pen 45 miles southwest of Sarasota.
Separately, environmental groups will challenge the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to authorize a permit to discharge fish waste into the Gulf of Mexico. Members of the Don't Cage Our Ocean Coalition, including Friends of the Earth and the Recirculating Farms Coalition, will appeal the permit.
The project – dubbed Velella Epsilon – will need both the construction permit from the Corps and the EPA permit before it can proceed.
The EPA authorized a permit to discharge 80,000 pounds of fish waste into the Gulf of Mexico from the first finfish farm ever authorized in federal waters, a key hurdle in making American offshore aquaculture a reality.
The EPA's assessment has indicated that there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with Ocean Era's project. However, environmental groups were quick to criticize the EPA's assessment.
They say offshore fish farms will create pollution in the form of fish waste, spread diseases to wild fish populations and increase competition with fishing companies that depend on wild catches.
Among the concerns about the permit: The EPA did not give a range of reasonable alternatives. The National Environmental Policy Act, which sets out requirements for environmental assessments or statements, is supposed to include reasonable alternatives.
This did not happen. The only alternatives were to issue or not to issue the permit.
The day the EPA issued the permit, residents and environmental activists testified online as part of two 90-minute public meetings. During the hearings, much of the concern also centered on this and future fish farms potentially exacerbating the harmful algal blooms such as red tide that have impacted the state's coastal economy in recent years.
Among the other concerns: the potential vulnerability of the project if a major hurricane were to sweep through it in the Gulf.
The copper mesh cage to be used is impact-resistant and designed to survive storm events while submerged. The EPA believes that the cage design will make it unlikely that fish will escape.
Issues of structural integrity and anchoring of the cage system pertain to the Army Corps permit application. The structural permit authorization will include permit conditions to ensure the facility is being operated and maintained to mitigate environmental impacts during any disaster.
Comments regarding the potential authorization of the project should be submitted in writing to the attention of the District Engineer through the Tampa Permits Section, 10117 Princess Palm Ave., Suite 120, Tampa, FL 33610-8302 or preferably by email at OceanEra_VEAquaculture@usace.army.mil.
The deadline to comment is Nov. 4.
Demonstrators protested in January against a proposal by Ocean Era to construct a finfish farm off the coast of Sarasota.

Full text: Sen. Marco Rubio joined two of his congressional colleagues to introduce bipartisan legislation to advance fish farms in federal waters.
Offshore aquaculture has been a contentious issue in Southwest Florida as environmentalists argue that a proposed pilot program 40 miles off Sarasota's shoreline would exacerbate harmful algae blooms and pose a risk to wild fisheries.
The bill rides the heels of a recent Eastern District court opinion upholding the stance that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lacks the proper authority to oversee offshore aquaculture. The Senate bill, Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture (AQUAA), is meant to be the legislative solution.
"Marine aquaculture presents an enormous opportunity for Florida's economy and for the food security of our nation," Rubio said in a news release. "I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation, alongside Senators Wicker and Schatz, that would streamline the rules for this important industry and responsibly promote its success."
Republican Sen. Roger Wicker represents Mississippi and Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz represents Hawaii. A similar bill is headed through the U.S. House.
"What this does is creates a management framework and that's what's been needed," said Neil Sims, CEO of Ocean Era — the company proposing the fish farm near Sarasota.
The Senate's AQUAA legislation proposes to set up national standards for the industry by establishing areas of opportunity in federal waters, management plans for farms and permitting procedures. Environmental regulations are not laid out in detail within the bill's language, but it requires offshore development be "consistent with environmental requirements established by law."
Marianne Cufone, an environmental attorney and executive director of Recirculating Farms, said that while Congress providing authority to a federal agency is the right process, offshore aquaculture is a dirty and outdated industry.
"It's especially concerning that Rubio is sponsoring the bill given that Florida residents have expressed tremendous concerns," she said. "There's been a tremendous amount of pushback from communities in that area and it sounds like Rubio is just not listening."
Recirculating Farms has joined other environmental groups in the Don't Cage our Ocean Coalition to speak out against the proposed Senate bill.
"We need strong environmental leadership from both sides of the aisle in Congress to ensure that our ecosystems remain resilient," Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said in a news release. "The last thing we should be doing is allowing corporations to dump even more toxins into our oceans by rubber-stamping these dangerous developments."
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorized a permit Thursday allowing Ocean Era's Velella Epsilon project to become the first ever authorized fish farm in federal waters. Velella Epsilon is the company's pilot program slated to raise 88,000 pounds of almaco jack in the Gulf of Mexico each year 45 miles southwest of Sarasota.
Margaret Henderson, campaign manager of Stronger America Through Seafood, said the bill is a pragmatic approach to an industry that is woefully needed in the country. Her group is an aquaculture advocacy group focused on federal-level changes.
"What's really important about this legislation is it does not in any way alter existing environmental statutes," she said. "All will remain completely intact under this legislation. Any of the impacts that would be associated with these operations would have to be legal and regulated under these statutes."
Cufone, citing recent environmental issues such as Southwest Florida's recurring red tide and coral die offs, said the state doesn't need any more pollution on its coasts.
"People are concerned about factory farms on land, why would they put them in the ocean?" she said. "There are just so many concerns and risks associated with this type of production that it seems unnecessary to undertake those kinds of risks."
Aaron Welch, a researcher at the University of Miami, said he understands the risks of harmful algae blooms but doesn't believe the proposed Ocean Era fish farm poses an environmental risk.
Welsh released a study in 2019 that found there was no significant difference in nutrient pollution in the water near a fish farm in the Caribbean Sea. Welsh and his fellow researchers monitored the farm, which produced 1,500 tons of fish each year, from 2012 to 2018.
"Gravity is pulling us in the direction of aquaculture," he said. "Right now, at the scale we are talking about, in my view there is nothing to worry about."
There is certainly, at some point, an upper limit to how many farms could exist in offshore waters, he said, and there are certain species of fish, such as non-natives, that he would not want to see raised.
"I would want to see reasonable regulations by the government, responsible regulation practices, both with the state and feds," he said. "In general, I am comfortable with aquaculture. It's the future. The U.S. can choose to do it or not, but the horse is out of the barn everywhere else in the world."
The Don't Cage our Ocean Coalition held a meeting Wednesday to raise awareness about the group's concerns.
Sarasota Mayor Jen Ahern-Koch attended the meeting, according to a report from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, and raised concerns that even the proposed pilot program would exacerbate Florida red tide.
The Senate's AQUAA bill is not the first time a federal aquaculture framework has been proposed in the Capitol.
Cufone said different forms of offshore fish farming acts have been pushed forward since the '80s.
"There's been attempts over time (to pass this type of legislation), but they failed at every juncture," Cufone said. "Every time it comes up there is an immense amount of public opposition that has stopped it."
Regardless of the legislation passing, the current permitting process allows companies such as Ocean Era to move forward with offshore farms.
"We can proceed under the exiting legislation," Sims said. "But it would be nice to have the framework and national management plan that gives industry participants comfort and it's what the county needs, it's what the planet needs."

Full text: The Center for Biological Diversity issued the following news release on Oct. 1:
The Environmental Protection Agency has authorized a permit to discharge 80,000 pounds of fish farm waste directly into the Gulf of Mexico from the first finfish farm ever authorized in federal waters. The Velella Epsilon experimental fish farm off Florida's west coast received the permit late yesterday, the EPA announced today.
"The EPA has not adequately addressed concerns about impacts to human health, the environment and imperiled wildlife," said Jaclyn Lopez, Florida director at the Center for Biological Diversity. "We're also concerned about this project's influence on red tide and Ocean Era Inc.'s ability to maintain the security of its fish farm during a severe storm."
The fish farm would rear up to 88,000 pounds of Almaco jack in public waters off the coast of Sarasota for 12-14 months in a submersible, copper-mesh fish pen. For every pound of fish reared, the fish farm may require up to two pounds of fish feed. Of the fish feed consumed, 10% is expelled as solid waste and 30% as liquid waste. The fish may also require antibiotics while in the pen.
The permit authorizes the direct discharge of up to 80,000 pounds of excess fish feed and feces into the Gulf of Mexico, which could amount to 36 pounds of ammonia nitrogen and 309 pounds of solid waste per day.
The fish farm will be in habitat used by imperiled Gulf of Mexico fish, including the giant manta ray, oceanic whitetip and smalltooth sawfish. It may also affect Endangered Species Act-listed sea turtles, including leatherback, Kemp's ridley, hawksbill, loggerhead and green sea turtles, as well as Florida manatees and six species of Gulf whales: blue whales, Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whales, fin whales, humpback whales, sei whales and sperm whales.
These endangered species can be attracted to the uneaten feed and feces from fish farms and become entangled in the pens, exposed to vessel strikes, and subjected to increased ocean noise.
The aquaculture industry also has many well-documented impacts on human health and the environment, including death and injury to industry workers, navigation hazards to other water users and antibiotic resistance in marine animals. Impacts on people include increased exposure to toxins.
Two additional concerns are red tide and storms. Studies suggest that nutrients that will likely be discharged from the fish farm can worsen red tide. Red tide produces brevetoxins that kill marine wildlife and cause respiratory and intestinal distress in humans.
Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms in the region, and concerns remain regarding Ocean Era Inc.'s ability to secure its fish farm under the force of a major storm or series of storms.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- On September 24, 2020, Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced bipartisan legislation, the Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture (AQUAA) Act (S. 4723) in the U.S. Senate. The bipartisan AQUAA Act, which has companion legislation in the U.S. House, would support development of an offshore aquaculture industry in the U.S. to increase the production of sustainable seafood and establish new economic opportunities in federal waters.
"The expansion of domestic offshore aquaculture is a win-win for American communities nationwide," said Bill DiMento, president of SATS and vice president of Corporate Sustainability and Government Affairs at High Liner Foods . "Growth of the American aquaculture industry would create new jobs, provide new business opportunities and grow our economy as our country recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the opportunities that aquaculture can provide American communities, there is growing bipartisan support and momentum for federal action on aquaculture."
The AQUAA Act would establish National Standards for offshore aquaculture and clarify a regulatory system for the development of aquaculture in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The legislation would also establish a research and technology grant program to fund innovative research and extension services focused on improving and advancing sustainable domestic aquaculture.
The expansion of aquaculture, one of the most resource efficient methods of producing animal protein, would complement the wild fish sector to meet growing demand for American seafood while protecting our fisheries and natural resources. In addition to boosting growth for the seafood industry, American aquaculture would provide a new market for U.S. farmers, specifically for crops such soybeans, corn and peas, which can be used to create fish feed and ease pressure on ocean resources.
"With our extended coastline, expansive ocean resources, skilled labor force, superior technology, and ample feed sources, the U.S. has the potential to be a global leader for aquaculture production. However, our potential will remain untapped unless and until federal action is taken to clarify the permitting process. SATS applauds Senators Wicker, Schatz and Rubio for working across party lines to bring awareness and encourage debate in Congress on the topic of expanding domestic aquaculture," DiMento concluded .
Tony Dal Ponte, vice president of SATS and general counsel at Pacific Seafood , said, "Expanding domestic aquaculture can help give a much needed boost to the American economy. A clear, predictable regulatory framework will benefit not just the seafood industry, but also the coastal communities who rely on it to support their local economies and provide stable, year-round employment opportunities."
"Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector, but the U.S. lacks a comprehensive, nationwide system for permitting in federal waters," said Senator Wicker . "This deficiency prevents the development of aquaculture farms, leading to more seafood imports. Our legislation would establish national standards for offshore aquaculture, enabling U.S. producers to create jobs and meet the growing demand for fresh, local seafood."
"Hawaii leads the nation in modern and traditional aquaculture practices," said Senator Schatz .  "With this bipartisan bill, we can expand aquaculture opportunities, opening suitable federal waters for responsible growers. It will create new jobs, spur economic growth in our coastal communities, and ensure our oceans are managed sustainably now and in the future."
"Marine aquaculture presents an enormous opportunity for Florida's economy and for the food security of our nation," said Senator Rubio . "I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation, alongside Senators Wicker and Schatz, that would streamline the rules for this important industry and responsibly promote its success."
The companion bill for The AQUAA Act in the U.S. House, H.R. 6191, was introduced by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D, MN-7) and Congressman Steven Palazzo (R, MS-4) in March 2020. The AQUAA Act complements the May 2020 Presidential Executive Order on American Seafood Competitiveness, which outlines a process for developing Aquaculture Opportunity Areas in federal waters, a key to supporting a domestic offshore aquaculture industry.

Full text: BY PATRICK WHITTLE
The Associated Press
PORTLAND, Maine - President Donald Trump wants to dramatically expand aquaculture production in the United States, but a coalition of environmentalists believes his plan would be bad for the oceans, unnecessary for food security and difficult to implement.
Trump's bid to grow fish farming is designed to address the so-called "seafood deficit," which refers to the fact that nine-tenths of the seafood Americans eat comes from overseas. The seafood trade gap with other countries approached $17 billion in 2017, according to one federal government report.
The president issued an executive order in May that promised broad changes in how the U.S. regulates fish farming. It included provisions to expedite the development of offshore aquaculture in deep federal waters. That sector of the industry has yet to emerge in the U.S., where most aquaculture takes place near shore where farmers grow salmon, oysters and other popular seafood items.
The Trump administration and the aquaculture industry said the order, which is being implemented now, represents common sense steps to ease the burden of rules on fish farmers. But environmental groups said it threatens to increase pollution and over-development in the ocean at a time when many consumers aren't buying seafood.
"They're trying to somehow connect open-water aquaculture with the need for domestic food. But it just doesn't make sense," said Marianne Cufone, executive director of the Recirculating Farms Coalition, one of several environmental groups that oppose the move. "Why we're seeing it during a pandemic, I don't know, I'm shaking my head."
The executive order gives the nation's regional fishery management councils, which regulate fisheries, six months to recommend "actions to reduce burdens on domestic fishing." One of the order's stated goals is "more effective permitting related to offshore aquaculture and additional streamlining of fishery regulations," with "the potential to revolutionize American seafood production."
The order aims to bring seafood production to the U.S. instead of keeping the nation dependent on other countries, said Paul Doremus, deputy assistant administrator for operations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.
"We're a major seafood consuming country and we could be producing more of that seafood internally," Doremus said. "That's the driving force behind the executive order as a whole."
Aquaculture in federal waters has support from some major fish farmers, including Cooke Aquaculture, a Canada-based seafood giant. Cooke spokesman Joel Richardson said the order shows Trump's administration knows "the world needs more aquaculture to feed the world." The company's operations include salmon farms in the nearshore waters of Maine.
Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said it's not the right time to grow fish farming. Seafood is popular in restaurants, and the coronavirus pandemic has caused many to shutter, at least temporarily. Seafood sales to restaurants fell 90% in the early weeks of the pandemic. The industry has since seen an infusion of CARES Act money to help it recover, but continues to struggle.
Templeton called offshore aquaculture "floating factory farms" and said they are more likely to cause pollution in the marine environment than provide sustainable food.
A recent court ruling dealt a blow to the prospects for offshore fish farming. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a decision Aug. 3 that federal law granting NOAA authority over fisheries does not also let the agency set rules for offshore fish farms. That scuttled rules that could have regulated fish farms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Environmental groups heralded the court's ruling because it likely makes it more difficult for farmers to start large offshore operations that would raise species such as tuna, salmon and seabass.
"Allowing net-pen aquaculture and its environmental harms in the Gulf of Mexico is a grave threat, and the court properly held the government cannot do so without new and proper Congressional authority," said George Kimbrell, Center for Food Safety legal director and a lead counsel in the case.
The prospect of offshore aquaculture has been contentious for years. President Barack Obama also took steps to permit deep water fish farming during his tenure.
The aquaculture industry remains hopeful that Trump's executive order can help pave the way for more fish farming, both nearshore and offshore. Paul Zajicek, executive director of the National Aquaculture Association, said the order isn't about eliminating regulations but rather "removing barriers to aquaculture permitting" for farmers.
Some fishing groups have also come out in support of the order. Scot Mackey, director of government affairs for the Garden State Seafood Association, which advocates for fishermen as well as farmers, said the order "will help the industry weather the current crisis and come back stronger."
Neville Crabbe, spokesman for the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a conservation group, said the federal permitting process should be creating land-based aquaculture rather than fish farms in the ocean, let alone offshore.
"It's not clear how locating that production just further away from the coasts would help with things like diseases and parasites and other problems that plague the industry today," he said.

Full text: The long, choppy quest to open up the Gulf of Mexico to large-scale fish farming began, in a way, some 30 years ago on the black pearl diving docks of Micronesia. That’s where the Australian businessman Neil Anthony Sims first met the American marine biologist Kevan Main. 
Their paths diverged – his to Hawaii to develop deep-water fish farming, hers to Florida to head the Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium in Sarasota – but the two remain key figures for a project that could transform not just the American dinner table, but also the economies of fishing ports from Alaska to Florida.
Velella Epsilon – the first fish farm in federal waters off the contiguous United States – would operate in the Gulf of Mexico, about 40 miles from Florida’s coast. Globe-shaped pens would hold fingerling almaco jack, a member of the amberjack genus, that would grow into 4-pound market fish within a year. If scaled with corporate investment, the project could eventually yield 64 million pounds of sushi-quality meat a year, enough to dramatically reshape the world’s seafood trade.
“People paying attention to the global impacts of humankind on the planet are saying we need more aquaculture, and offshore fish farms are a really scaleable, sustainable, low-impact form of aquaculture,” says Mr. Sims, the co-founder and CEO of Ocean Era, the company behind the Velella Epsilon project, in a phone call from Hawaii. “There’s deep water. You are further from shore. The currents are better. You work within the assimilative capacities of the system.” 
As Velella Epsilon gains steam even under heavy regulatory headwinds, that phrase – “assimilative capacities,” the ability for the natural environment to safely absorb pollutants – will be key in a broader gambit for U.S. protein independence. At stake is whether markets and permits are enough to tackle the larger ethical questions about how to integrate fish farming into the complexities of a system that includes not just the Gulf of Mexico, but Americans who make a living off it.
“How much of the landscape and the seascape should human beings be using?” asks Philip Cafaro, a philosophy professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. “You have to be explicit about what your goals are. If it’s to maximize profits in the fishing industry, that’s one thing. If your goal is to maximize output to the fishing industry in order to protect communities, that’s a very different one.”
In a big pond In 1986, the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia imported nearly 20,000 pounds of black-lipped pearl oysters, a species known for its high quality black pearls, and raised them in Chuuk Lagoon. At first, little was done to develop the fledgling republic’s nascent aquaculture.
But as Micronesia’s black pearl industry began to shift to a more managed model in the 1990s, “we saw a transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer,” says Mr. Sims. “And it took years of bitter fighting. But now those communities have reversed a brain drain because there are now millionaires in those communities.” 
Mr. Sims’ goal off the coast of Florida is much the same, he says. “The primary driver behind Velella Epsilon is to showcase it to the fishing community as a great asset.”
It's now unclear which government agency has authority to approve the Velella Epsilon project, but which would test the feasibility of fish farming in a high-risk environment. It also represents the latest effort to push aquaculture through the regulatory maze that binds the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to eight regional fishery councils, which in turn set the rules for managing the wild stock. 
The White House appears eager to open federal waters to aquaculture. With Executive Order 13921, President Donald Trump on May 7 ordered NOAA to winnow down regulations for both aquaculture and wild-caught fish. Last week NOAA announced that it would be creating 10 Aquaculture Opportunity Areas, including one in the Gulf. 
But this push for open-ocean fish farming has faced legal hurdles. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that NOAA lacked the authority to take the lead in regulating aquaculture in federal waters, a victory for the environmental groups and fishing associations who brought the suit. Those groups have argued that open-sea aquaculture is too risky and too dependent on the market’s whims. 
“A slice of the population looks at the oceans and thinks of them as a last, wild frontier, and to have farming in that last wild frontier is anathema to them,” says Paul Zajicek, executive director of the National Aquaculture Association in Tallahassee, Florida.
Ocean aquaculture is not without its environmental costs, such as escaped fish, parasites, and “fish sewage.” Though some of those problems are more endemic to near-shore fish farms, concerns remain among environmentalists and many Florida residents that deep-sea cultivation would prove even more complex, but with less oversight.
“It’s an ethical issue akin to raising tigers for consumption: You’re fishing up the food chain,” says Zach Corrigan, a senior attorney at the Washington-based nonprofit Food & Water Watch, which opposes the project. “I don’t think [Mr. Sims] represents what is really the best economic model for these fish farms, which is going to be cheaply produced fish out there on the fly. At that point you’re not competing against the imports, you’re producing expensive, high-grade product for your own dollars.” 
Opening a can of worms To James Bois, a commercial fisherman based here in Cortez, it’s unclear how a massive fish farm operation off the coast of Cortez will change his life. But he does know that unless Americans suddenly start consuming more seafood, his wild-caught fish – amberjack is on his list of allowable catch – will have to compete against Mr. Sims’ farmed almaco jack.
At the same time, fishing regulations deemed necessary to protect vulnerable stocks have reshaped Cortez. Today, the funky little slice of pre-Disney Florida is largely a bait fishery for larger fleet boats. If Mr. Sims began buying local bait to feed his fish, it could create a boom for Cortez, in the short term. Yet part of the plan to make open-ocean farming truly sustainable is to replace bait fish with a plant-based feed laced with algae oil. It takes 5 pounds of feed to build 1 pound of fish protein.
“Offshore farming can help us or hurt us. We don’t know which yet,” says Mr. Bois. “But one thing I know 100%: It will affect us.” 
Market dynamics, court battles, and political battles seem far on the horizon from the Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium, on the outskirts of Sarasota. There, Ms. Main runs her marine workshop: tubs, PVC pipes, and notes on pH and salinity scrawled on wipe-boards. Ms. Main is the aquaculture scientist who solved the mystery of spawning snook. She helped pioneer pompano as a farmed fish. She has also farmed sturgeon and redfish.
Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium, Ms. Main points out, is not involved in the planning or operation of Velella Epsilon. But Mote has been contracted to provide some 20,000 fingerlings for the project’s initial cohort of fish.
As she leans over a massive tank, she points to 28-day-old almaco jack fry gorging on brine shrimp. “Look at those little tiny row boats,” she says.
Indeed, her problems are far more immediate, given her hopes to have the demonstration pen operating by December. She is losing more of the almaco jack fry than she was expecting, forcing a reevaluation of the feeding plan. 
But what’s harder to control than salinity is perception. In a way, how a dream to farm the open oceans clashes with shifting values on land is embodied by her work.
“We should be producing food that we eat in this country,” she says. “It’s really important, because we will do it right, it’ll be subject to our regulations, and we know what we’ll be getting.”

Full text: Florida's agriculture commissioner this week endorsed a federal administration's move to designate an aquaculture area in the Gulf of Mexico, a step some environmentalists consider a threat to a vital Florida resource: its waters.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, under President Donald Trump's recent executive order on seafood, has chosen the Gulf as one of 10 established Aquaculture Opportunity Areas. Currently, there are no offshore fish farms in federal waters.
These areas, or AOAs, are meant for "sustainable commercial aquaculture," according to NOAA's website and will be the beginning stages of a public process to outline specific areas. Under President Trump's order, environmental impact statements must be completed for each AOA.
Environmentalists worry that offshore aquaculture in Southwest Florida could exacerbate harmful algal blooms from excess nutrient pollution, among other ecosystem concerns.
Commissioner Nicole "Nikki" Fried of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued a news release on Thursday in favor of NOAA's efforts.
"Florida's Gulf Coast waters are ideal to receive an Aquaculture Opportunity Area, and we welcome today's announcement towards that end," Fried wrote in the release. "Our proven aquaculture and seafood history makes our state perfectly positioned to advance an environmentally sustainable offshore aquaculture industry."
In the release, she says U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott are also on board for the decision to designate a portion of the Gulf for offshore aquaculture.
"The U.S. EPA would be responsible for NPDES permitting for offshore aquaculture operations in federal waters," Franco Ripple, director of communications for the ag commission wrote in an email. "FDACS would be involved in a supporting role to the federal agencies (for environmental permits)."
NOAA has not released maps or coordinates outlining exactly where the Gulf's AOA would be, but a proposed fish farm already has been planned for three years.
Ocean Era — formerly Kampachi Farms — has been pursuing a demonstration pen in the Gulf for a finfish farm 45 miles southwest of Sarasota.
Neil Sims, founder and CEO of Ocean Era, has said offshore aquaculture is the path toward a sustainable future.
"From an environmental standpoint, the U.S. needs more aquaculture," he said. "This is an environmental imperative that we cannot ignore. We cannot feed 9 billion people with terrestrial animal protein at the rate Americans eat meat – there's not enough land, or fresh water, and there's too much (greenhouse gas) emissions."
Ocean Era's demonstration pen, called Velella Epsilon, will raise 88,000 pounds of almaco jack fish each year — the same amount caught by commercial fishers in Florida each year.
Sims said the AOAs will likely trim down the timelines aquaculture entrepreneurs go through when establishing offshore fish farms.
"There would still be the same permit regulatory requirements," he said. "Just that AOAs would have a priori identified areas of minimal conflict with other ocean user groups through that community consultation process. That would mean that we wouldn't have to go through that ourselves."
NOAA's designation of the AOA's comes on the heels of a federal appeals court opinion stating the administration does not have the authority to permit and regulate offshore fisheries. Sims said it's likely that the president's executive order overrules the court's decision.
Marianne Cufone, an environmental attorney and executive director of Recirculating Farms, said these designations probably don't mean much.
"It's just the beginning of something that probably won't happen for years," she said. "It's important to remember there's an election in November, and depending on what happens in that election, all of this can go away because it's in response to an executive order and those can be overturned."
Cufone said the state backing NOAA's proposed aquaculture areas is disappointing.
"The public has loudly and repeatedly said they don't want this," she said. "The State of Florida as well as NOAA are just not getting the message or are not hearing the public, or they are not listening and that's problematic."

Full text: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday chose the Gulf of Mexico as one of two places where it will look to grow offshore fish farming.

The gulf joins Southern California in becoming an Aquaculture Opportunity Area, the first two in the United States. President Donald Trump issued an executive order this year outlining the concept as a way of boosting the countrys seafood industry and reducing its reliance on imported fish. The selection covers federal waters but does not identify more specific locations.

The creation of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas will foster the U.S. aquaculture industry as a needed complement to our wild-capture fisheries, said Chris Oliver, the assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries, in a statement. This type of proactive work creates opportunities for aquaculture farmers and maintains our commitment to environmental stewardship.

For proponents, the industry is a way to expand jobs and seafood harvests without overfishing. But some advocacy groups are divided on whether aquaculture is a good investment. They raise concerns about fish waste dirtying the water and farmed species passing diseases to wild marine life.

The designation granted Thursday does not mean farms will instantly pop up on the Florida coast. The administration said to pick specific locations for farms, it will go through a process involving scientific studies, working with state officials and hold

ing public meetings. The gulf could host three to five operations, potentially involving finfish, shellfish and seaweed, according to the announcement. Federal waters start a little more than 10 miles from the states western shore.

One fish project already predates the opportunity area, and it is near Florida. Operators are awaiting a permitting decision from the Environmental Protection Agency on a pitch to raise almaco jack 45 miles west of Sarasota. Neil Anthony Sims, founder of the company behind that effort, Ocean Era, said the eastern gulf is a good location because it has clear, warm water and no oil rigs or heavy commercial traffic that could interfere with farming.

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in June wrote a letter to the secretary of commerce asking for the state to be considered as an Aquaculture Opportunity Area. She noted that the state already has a leasing program for submerged lands, regulating thousands of plots as farmers raise clams and oysters.

Florida is uniquely positioned to advance an environmentally sustainable offshore aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic Ocean, Fried wrote.

The administrations announcement comes weeks after a federal court dealt a setback to aquaculture in the gulf, affirming that traditional fisheries oversight does not cover farming and regulation will require action from Congress.

Marianne Cufone, an attorney on that case and director of the environmental law program at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, said Thursdays news indicates the agency is not getting the message.

This administration just is doing its own thing unfortunately, she said.

Sims, from Ocean Era, has said his groups project would not cause harm to the environment and would be sustainable, despite some community opposition. He said the federal government is smart to identify areas appropriate for fish farms before companies do it themselves.

In terms of community consultation, thats a tremendous step, he said. Aquaculture Opportunity Areas will make future applications easier for other applicants.

Full text: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) welcomes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) announcement that the Gulf of Mexico region has been selected as an Aquaculture Opportunity Area.
This announcement comes after Rubio sent a letter to U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to designate waters near Florida as one of the first aquaculture opportunity areas, as detailed in President Trump's May 7, 2020 Executive Order, "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth." The exact locations of the aquaculture farm sites will be selected based on public input, scientific analysis of spatial availability and environmental factors, and in coordination with states and regional fishery commissions.
"It is welcome news that NOAA has selected the Gulf of Mexico region as one of the first aquaculture opportunity areas," Rubio said.
"As NOAA determines the exact locations of the aquaculture farm sites, I hope that they consider federal waters near Florida as a common-sense option. I look forward to working with the Administration to promote a more resilient domestic food supply chain to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign fish stocks and help ensure that Americans continue to have access to nutritious seafood."
* * *
Dear Secretary Ross:
We write to you regarding President Trump's May 7, 2020 Executive Order titled, "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth," which directs you to identify aquaculture opportunity areas in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ). As you seek to identify such areas, we request your consideration of designating waters near Florida as an aquaculture opportunity area.
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has shined a new light on the need to promote domestic industries to help ensure that Americans have consistent access to necessities, including various food commodities. The fact that most of the seafood consumed by Americans is imported from other countries lends uncertainty to the prospects of a stable supply of seafood in the future. As China has severely depleted its own fish stocks, it has turned to plundering the waters of other nations, putting fish stocks at risk globally. Aquaculture is poised to be an aspect of any solution to address these issues, and President Trump's Executive Order is a major step in the right direction towards securing domestic food resources and access for Americans to nutritious seafood.
In pursuit of a more resilient domestic food supply chain, we hope you agree that Florida is a common-sense option for one of the first aquaculture opportunity areas under the Executive Order. With more than 1,300 miles of coastline, a significant portion of the U.S. EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean rests in the temperate waters near Florida. Our mild winter climate offers opportunities to harvest species of native tropical finfish year-round. Further, Florida is uniquely situated as a central location between the Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern Seaboard, which helps ensure that seafood harvested in waters near Florida expeditiously reaches its end market and remains fresh.
We commend President Trump's leadership in working to ensure our economy works for Americans, instead of against them, and we look forward to the result of your department's hard work in advancing these priorities.

Full text: The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued the following news release on Aug. 20:
Today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the selection of sites in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico as one of the first locations designated as Aquaculture Opportunity Areas. The announcement comes after Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried sent a letter to the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, asking that the department consider designating waters off Florida's coast as an Aquaculture Opportunity Area.
Echoing Commissioner Fried's call were U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, the National Aquaculture Association, the Florida Aquaculture Association, the Florida Farm Bureau Federation, Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium, Gulfstream Aquaculture, Ocean Era, Dr. Daniel Benetti of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, and Dr. Steve Murawski of the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science.
"Florida's Gulf Coast waters are ideal to receive an Aquaculture Opportunity Area, and we welcome today's announcement towards that end. Our proven aquaculture and seafood history makes our state perfectly positioned to advance an environmentally sustainable offshore aquaculture industry," said Commissioner Fried. "As Florida's lead aquaculture agency, we look to balance economic development with environmental conservation, which has helped our aquaculture industry more than double in 30 years. We look forward to continue working with NOAA and stand ready to help our nation strengthen our domestic seafood supply."
About Aquaculture Opportunity Areas: Aquaculture Opportunity Areas were called for in the May 2020 Executive Order "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" issued by The White House. They are defined as geographic areas that have been evaluated for their potential for sustainable commercial aquaculture. Aquaculture Opportunity Area selection is based on spatial data and current industry interest in developing sustainable aquaculture operations in the region. Exact locations of aquaculture farm sites are yet to be determined, but will be selected based on public input, in-depth spatial and environmental factor analysis, and in coordination with states and regional fishery commission.
The selection of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas is the first step in a process designed to establish ten locations nationwide by 2025. Selected areas are expected to support multiple aquaculture farm sites of varying types, including finfish, shellfish, seaweed, or some combination of these farm types. Aquaculture Opportunity Areas and an expanded domestic aquaculture industry are critical for our coastal communities' economic and environmental resiliency and national food security.

To: The Honorable Wilbur Ross, Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230
Dear Secretary Ross,
I write to you today as Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture on behalf of Florida's robust and diverse seafood and aquaculture industries, and in response to the Executive Order (EO) "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" issued by the White House on May 7, 2020.
In line with the Executive Order's objectives, Florida's seafood industry, which generates $3.2 billion annually and supports more than 76,000 jobs, actively supports the bolstering of the national seafood sector by increasing competitiveness through critical international seafood trade reform and enhancing protection of the nation's sustainably managed fisheries. As Florida's lead aquaculture agency, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) strongly urges the U.S. Department of Commerce to consider Florida as a vital partner in enacting these critical goals.
As one of the fastest growing agribusinesses in the world, aquaculture is rapidly expanding in both diversity and scale to meet the growing demand for safe, affordable, and nutritious seafood commodities. While the U.S. has been a leader in technological innovations and production research, our country has experienced virtually none of the economic benefits due to cumbersome and uncertain federal policies, or the lack thereof.
It is evident through the issuance of this EO and the introduction of the bipartisan Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture Act (H.R.6191), that the federal government is willing to make the necessary policy changes and investments to increase domestic aquaculture production. As the U.S. Department of Commerce takes steps to enact Sections 6, 7, and 9 of this EO, I encourage you to consider the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services as a potential partner in supporting permitting procedures, ready to seize the development opportunities forthcoming.
Florida is uniquely positioned to advance an environmentally sustainable offshore aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic Ocean. Our state has a proven and streamlined submerged-lands leasing process for marine aquaculture that has functioned for decades, and to date oversees 1,304 aquaculture lease parcels covering 3,918 acres of state waters. As acknowledged in the EO, security of tenure for a minimum of ten years -- already well established in Florida law -- is essential for aquaculture leaseholders to secure capital and investor confidence for business development.
Our Department has been actively engaged at the state level in developing the offshore aquaculture industry similarly aligned with the EO objectives for several years. In partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Center for Coastal Ocean Science (NOAA NCCOS), the Offshore Aquaculture Spatial Planning in Florida project has identified several large areas in the Gulf of Mexico ideal for the development of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas in state and federal waters off of Florida's coast, critical for the development of this offshore industry.
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has a long and established history of working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to develop, update, and manage permits for marine aquaculture. Not only do we maintain a unique general permit for shellfish and live rock aquaculture in state waters, but we are also actively working to modify this permit to allow seaweed farms to be sited in state waters. However, our permit modification review and consultation process has now been underway for more than one year with no significant progress from NOAA nor USACE. This resource-intensive and time-consuming permitting process is difficult for state agencies with extensive expertise to navigate, much less individual businesses.
Our experiences underscore the desperate need for transparent and streamlined federal permitting mechanisms. I cannot overstate the need for a "One Federal Decision" process for aquaculture permitting and timely interagency review of both state and public permit requests.
I am formally requesting that the U.S. Department of Commerce consider Florida when designating Aquaculture Opportunity Areas within the next year. Our proactive work with NOAA NCCOS and distinctive regulatory framework would allow us to proceed with the Environmental Impact Statement process expeditiously. We also actively support the inclusion of state waters as the USACE works to develop nationwide permits for finfish and seaweed aquaculture, as stated in Section 6, subparts (b)(ii) and (iv) of the EO.
I urge the U.S. Department of Commerce and Congress to take bold action to enact common-sense policies that will advance sustainable offshore aquaculture and benefit American farmers, the jobs they support, and the families they feed. As Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture, our Department and Division of Aquaculture stand ready to assist with these new efforts.
Sincerely,
Nicole "Nikki" Fried, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture

Full text: "(The opinion) is significant because the case correctly indicates this new industry is unable to move forward without a law by Congress. Essentially no agency has the authority. Right now we've got a stop to the development of ocean aquaculture."
Marianne Cufone
An environmental attorney and executive director of Recirculating Farms
As a proposed finfish farm awaits word on its demonstration pen in the Gulf of Mexico, a federal appeals court upheld a decision revoking authority from a federal agency to permit and regulate offshore fisheries.
The opinion Monday comes after a 2018 federal district ruling. The Gulf Fishermen's Association claimed aquaculture regulations fall outside the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service authority.
Environmental groups who brought the litigation call the opinion a victory in their efforts to stop offshore fish farming from gaining ground in the U.S. However, Neil Sims, founder and CEO of aquaculture company Ocean Era, said the court's decision won't hinder his progress and means one less permit for an offshore finfish farm.
Sims said the decision could leave a gap in the regulation of the industry. His company's efforts to build Velella Epsilon, a demonstration pen about 45 miles southwest of Sarasota in the Gulf, remain undeterred.
"It begs the question: If NOAA doesn't regulate, who is going to coordinate regulation of aquaculture," Sims said. "(NOAA) is the logical entity"
Environmentalists say pollution from fish farms can feed harmful algal blooms. Sims said he has addressed this with "excessive monitoring" of pens that show no significant effects.
With NOAA unable to issue offshore aquaculture permits, Sims said the Environmental Protection Agency stepped forward to be the lead agency, and all the appeals court decision means is that Ocean Era's Velella Epsilon project in the Gulf will not need a permit from NOAA.
"It's one less permit for the demonstration pen, but the ideal would be to have a robust management framework in place," he said.
Opponents of the proposed finfish farm consider the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion a victory, saying Congress would now need to grant NOAA explicit authority to permit these farms in federally controlled ocean waters.
"(The opinion) is significant because the case correctly indicates this new industry is unable to move forward without a law by Congress," Marianne Cufone, an environmental attorney and executive director of Recirculating Farms, said. "Essentially no agency has the authority. Right now we've got a stop to the development of ocean aquaculture."
While the EPA can potentially issue a permit for discharges into federal waters, it still lacks authority to regulate the industry, she said. Because the original ruling and the assent of the recent opinion are federal, Cufone said precedent is set outside of the eastern district where the ruling took place.
The decision was filed on Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals Fifth District in New Orleans.
"Really the (offshore aquaculture) industry is so outdated," she said. "Agencies should really focus attention developing more sustainable and modern (methods)."
The opinion and original 2018 case argue that aquaculture is not fishing, and therefore falls outside of current federal authority.
"Today's decision makes clear what we have said all along: Congress never intended for the federal government to allow massive factory fish farms in federal waters," Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food and Water Watch, wrote in a news release.
Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner for the environmental advocacy group Friends of the Earth, told the Daily News in May that because NOAA is within the U.S. Department of Commerce, there were also concerns about a potential conflict of interest.
"It's like the fox guarding the hen house," she said. "If you want the industry to succeed, you may not pay attention to the environment."
George Kimbrell, lead counsel in the case, called the appeals' court opinion a landmark victory.
"Allowing net-pen aquaculture and its environmental harms in the Gulf of Mexico is a grave threat, and the Court properly held the government cannot do so without new and proper Congressional authority," he wrote in the release. "Aquaculture harms cannot be shoehorned under existing law never intended for that purpose."
Despite the court's opinion and the opposition his company faces, Sims and Ocean Era remain optimistic that Velella Epsilon will move forward.
"It's the way the world should be. We should have rational management regulations in place. We in the industry are asking for that," he said. "We want to see this industry well managed and coordinated in its development."
The Ocean Era demonstration pen is still waiting to hear back from the EPA on a potential permit to discharge into the Gulf.

Full text: The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee issued the following testimony by Leann Bosarge, member of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, at a hearing entitled "Building a Stronger and More Resilient Seafood Sector":
As a brief background on myself, I hail from a long line of commercial fishermen, who over the years have harvested everything from butterfish and red snapper to oysters, crabs and shrimp. I grew up working at our family business, Bosarge Boats, which owns and operates a fleet of trawl vessels, i.e. shrimp boats, which fish the waters of both the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. I was the first member of my family to earn a college degree - of course working at the family business all the while. After college, I carried out my mother's wishes to at least try another industry, I spent a few years working for a publicly traded financial institution, before returning to my true love - the commercial fishing industry and the family business. In 2013, I was appointed to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and was honored to be elected and serve as Chairman of the Council from 2016 to 2018. I'm currently in my third term on the Council as a voting member, and I am honored to have had the opportunity to share in shaping the future of our fisheries and ensuring their long term, science-based sustainability.
Gulf perspective on the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on the seafood industry
There is not an industry in this country that has been unscathed by COVID-19, but I feel it important to first acknowledge those who have lost loved ones as they have endured the greatest sacrifice.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a wide range of adverse socio-economic impacts on the Gulf of Mexico seafood industry. These impacts are still unfolding and include significant decreases in ex-vessel landings, employment losses, disruptions to the supply chains of seafood products, price decreases and sizeable reductions in revenues across all nodes of the supply chains for most seafood species landed in Gulf of Mexico.
As restaurants continued to close, orders of seafood products began to decrease and in some cases disappear. In turn, the depressed demand for seafood products by restaurants has led seafood dealers to drastically reduce or temporarily suspend orders from commercial fishermen. In reaction to the reductions in orders from dealers, commercial fishermen had to adjust their operations downward. These adjustments continue to include decreases in the number of commercial fishing trips taken, drops in the quantity of fish harvested per trip and reductions to the number of crew members taken out on a given fishing trip. This sequence of events continues to adversely impact employment prospects throughout our supply chains.
In the following sections, I will briefly discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial finfish and shrimp sectors, with a particular emphasis on changes in ex-vessel landings and revenues. The detrimental effects on the seafood industry are still unfolding, due to the continuing evolution of this pandemic. In the Gulf of Mexico, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) through its South East Regional Office (SERO) and South East Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) are designing or conducting studies to evaluate these effects. At a state level, through their state fisheries departments or sea grant and extension services, the five constituting states are developing or are conducting ongoing surveys to assess the impacts of the pandemic on their respective state fisheries sectors. Therefore, examples and data included in my testimony rely on regional and Gulf-wide data from NMFS or state-specific data, depending on availability.
For finfish fisheries, there is a general downward trend in ex-vessel landings associated with economic losses borne by commercial fishermen due to decreases in ex-vessel revenues. Compared to the first half of 2019, ex-vessel revenues from finfish for the first 6 months of 2020 have decreased by 23% in the Southeast region, which includes the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
Examples of individual Gulf of Mexico reef fish species with noteworthy reductions in ex-vessel landings and revenues during the same time interval include greater amberjack and yellowtail snapper. For greater amberjack and yellowtail snapper, ex-vessel landings decreased by 46% and 51%, respectively. Associated decreases in greater amberjack and yellowtail snapper ex-vessel revenues were 42% and 55%, respectively.
Preliminary data from a University of Florida and Florida Sea Grant survey of about 300 commercial fishermen provide an example of the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial fisheries at the state level. Survey respondents reported a 74% average revenue loss due to the pandemic. Subsets of respondents including reef fish or coastal migratory pelagic fishermen reported average losses in revenues of 76% and 72%, respectively. In an accompanying survey, Florida seafood wholesale dealers report, on average, 70% revenue losses due to COVID-19.
A survey administered by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Louisiana Sea Grant, and Department of Wildlife and Fisheries illustrates revenue losses and reductions in employment borne by seafood dock owners and dealers in Louisiana. Preliminary survey results indicate a 51% average decrease in revenues among respondents during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of last year. Survey respondents also reported a loss of all foreign personnel and a 55% average decrease in full time employment. Losses in employment were somewhat mitigated as dealers and dock operators converted some of the laid off full time workforce to part-time.
In the University of Florida and Florida Sea Grant survey I mentioned earlier, survey respondents who are commercial shrimp fishermen reported 63% average revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Southern Shrimp Alliance (SSA), a shrimp industry organization, aggregate shrimp landings in the Gulf of Mexico during the first six months of 2020 were the lowest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The SSA further indicates that Gulf shrimp landings during the first half of 2020 were about 38% lower than the previous 18-year average for landings.
In addition to these effects, because commercial fishermen and dealers can no longer primarily rely on orders from restaurants and institutional clients such as corporate clients, large venues, event organizers, and universities, the traditional repartition of seafood consumption between seafood consumed away from home and seafood bought at retail outlets for in-house consumption has been upended. According to the Washington Post (Laura Reiley, April 8, 2020), US consumers spend approximately twice as much on seafood consumed away from home relative to seafood bought in grocery and retail stores for in-house consumption. The proportions of seafood consumed away from home and seafood products bought at retail for in-home consumption are approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. In a July 20, 2020 article, Seafood News, a seafood trade magazine, notes that with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of seafood products consumed at home has increased by as much as 20%. The persistence of such a trend could result in seafood consumed at home representing as much as 65% of the total seafood consumption. The increase in the relative importance of in-house seafood consumption may offer future opportunities to develop retail markets. However, the development of reliable and profitable market relationships with retailers is not without challenges for commercial fishermen. While commercial fishermen primarily concentrated on supplying seafood to restauranteurs, retail chains heavily relied on imported seafood to satisfy their customer demand. Therefore, domestic commercial fishermen would have to compete with cheaper imported product to further develop relationships with the retail sector.
CARES Act
On May 7, 2020, the Secretary of Commerce announced the allocation of $300 million in fisheries assistance funding provided by Sec. 12005 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also called the CARES Act, to states, Tribes, and territories with coastal and marine fishery participants who have been negatively affected by COVID-19.
The purpose of the CARES Act allocation is to provide timely financial relief to commercial fishermen, seafood wholesale dealers, charter fishing businesses, and marine aquaculture businesses that have suffered financial losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this financial relief is much needed in the Gulf of Mexico, to date no funds have been made available to the affected industry participants. It is anticipated most state spend plans will be drafted by the states by mid-July. Those plans will then be reviewed and approved by NOAA before money is distributed to those impacted. On behalf of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, I would like to encourage an expedited effort to make these funds directly available to the intended recipients to mitigate financial losses and prevent further harm to Gulf of Mexico fisherman.
Under this Act, NOAA Fisheries has allocated $28M in support of Gulf of Mexico Fisheries to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. An additional $23M has been allocated to Florida (both east and west coasts) through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council looks forward to the positive impacts resulting from the CARES Act but is not directly involved in the administration of funds or programmatic activities.
The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission is working with Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to develop spend plans on how the allocated funds [Louisiana ($14,785,244), Texas ($9,237,949), Alabama ($3,299,821) and Mississippi ($1,534,388)] will be distributed to qualified fishery participants. As noted above, Florida has been allocated $23,471,286 through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Please note that the final allocations are slightly less due to administrative costs for NOAA Fisheries and the Commission. I am also grateful for the foresight of leaders in capping the administrative fee percentages which could be deducted from these funds, thereby ensuring that a greater portion of the funds will end up in the hands of the fishermen affect by the pandemic.
Priorities for Future Legislative or Administrative Action
The strength of our U.S. domestic fisheries lies in management that is based on science. In the Gulf of Mexico, many of our fisheries are currently harvested at the maximum sustainable amount allowed by the biological science. Legally mandated catch limits protect the health of our stocks today and also ensure that our fishermen's livelihoods and our nation's seafood supply are sustainable into the future. One of the most important priorities for the future of domestic commercial seafood is to diversify our supply chain and expand our target markets. The need for diversifying our supply chain has been laid bare this year as the seafood industry has been heavily impacted from the closures due to COVID-19 described above. Promoting commercial fishing and increasing the demand for our domestic product will increase American jobs, both primary and secondary jobs, strengthen the American economy via the increased revenues, and add to our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over the last 10 years, the value of seafood imported into the United States has increased by $7.3 billion,/1 reflecting growing demand for seafood in this country. Meeting this increased American demand with domestically produced seafood, as opposed to imported seafood, will create lasting gains for commercial fishing in this country and ensure our national food security.
The following are some ideas for future legislative or administrative action that will strengthen the domestic commercial fishing industry as well as our national economy. The Gulf Council brainstormed and formulated a list of ideas at its last meeting in the context of recommending actions to promote American seafood competitiveness and economic growth, in response to Executive Order 13921. The Gulf Council will continue to discuss these and other ideas in greater detail and will formalize its recommended proposals at a future Council meeting. Many of these ideas were on the initial list formulated by the Gulf Council, but the further fleshing out of these ideas below is specific to the commercial industry and does not necessarily reflect the Gulf Council, which has not had an opportunity to contribute its thoughts to today's hearing.
Increased Testing of Imported Seafood
Testing of imported seafood should be increased to ensure that FDA standards are met and that imports do not contain prohibited chemical substances, such as banned antibiotics, which is prevalent in imported seafood species, especially shrimp. These substances are added to enhance yield and to produce the product more cheaply, but can cause health concerns and often displace domestic seafood products in restaurants and grocery stores. In fiscal year 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested just 0.1% of seafood entry lines for the presence of veterinary drug residues./2
In contrast, the European Union (EU) requires that 50% of all shipments of farmed seafood from India be tested for veterinary drug residues prior to being allowed into the EU market./3
Worse, as the EU has increased its testing to prevent access of contaminated shrimp to its markets, the EU's efforts to protect European consumers have led to the diversion of these tainted exports to the U.S. market, which lacks the more stringent testing. Increasing the testing of imported seafood would therefore improve the quality of imported seafood and ensure that our domestic fishermen are competing on a fair playing field by rejecting contaminated product. Therefore, I humbly request that Congress consider prioritizing funds towards increased testing of imported seafood.
Country of Origin Labeling for Seafood on Restaurant Menus Nationwide
The closures due to COVID-19 revealed that a significant amount of our domestic seafood is consumed in restaurants rather than purchased at grocery stores to be prepared at home./4
Although labeling the country of origin for seafood imports is required in grocery stores, it is not generally required in restaurants./5
As consumers have become more conscientious about the source of their food, demand has increased for domestic wild caught seafood. Unfortunately, consumers have no way of knowing the source (i.e., country of origin) of what they are served at a restaurant. It's time to establish a nationwide policy for restaurants to inform consumers on the origin of seafood menu items so American consumers can make informed decisions on their seafood choices, the majority of which occur in restaurants. Given we are in the throws of a pandemic, maybe this effort could begin initially with a tax incentive, i.e. stimulus, for restaurants willing to place country of origin labeling for seafood on their menus. In this way, both the restaurant industry and the domestic commercial seafood industry gain. At the point in time when this temporary stimulus effort is set to expire, an evaluation can be made of the willingness of restaurants to engage in this type of reporting for consumers. If it seems the country of origin labeling was in fact palatable to the restaurant industry, then maybe legislation requiring it across the board would not be burdensome at that future date.
Establishing the Infrastructure for a Nationwide Online Seafood Marketplace
Consumers have become more conscientious about the quality and source of their seafood, creating an opportunity to promote the diversification of the supply chain and expansion of target markets by connecting consumers to fishermen and fish houses. With agency assistance, infrastructure could be established for an online platform to help the industry better market its product and to facilitate access for consumers nationwide. Such a direct sea-to-consumer platform would also strengthen the domestic seafood supply chain. The Seafood Trade Task Force created by the recent Executive Order 1392 would serve as an excellent starting point for such a project, and I hope the scope and mission of that group will be expanded to allow them the freedom to pursue this and other endeavors which may strengthen the resilience of our domestic seafood industry.
Put Domestic Seafood on Public School Lunch Menus and Prohibit Imported Seafood on Public School Lunch Menus
Our domestic seafood target market should be diversified to include public school lunch menus, in a real and meaningful way, across the country. It is shameful that our children are not receiving ample seafood in school. What children eat is important, and they should eat balanced diets at school - which includes seafood as a protein option. The quality and healthiness of our school lunches lags behind consumers' broader movement towards healthy food choices, which could be addressed by providing a healthy, low-fat protein source. Add to this the fact that domestic wild-caught seafood is naturally fortified with vitamins and minerals that are essential for children's growth and development, both physical and mental. And yet, even the cheapest of seafood options cannot be found on the lunch menu in most of our public schools. In addition to promoting our children and grandchildren's health, it will also promote food security for the future by the creation of a long-term, stable demand source for domestic seafood.
Support of Young Fishermen Development Programs
For many years, commercial fishing has been a generational pursuit, with the children of fishermen often following in their parents' footsteps. However, for some time, the average age of participants in U.S. domestic fisheries has been increasing while labor recruitment into domestic fisheries has been waning, termed "the graying of the fleet" in commercial fisheries. This has led to labor issues in supplying domestic seafood to the U.S. marketplace. We need to let our young people know that commercial fishing is a viable profession and add this career path to vocational training programs. In pursuit of this, Young Fishermen Development Programs are being established around the country. I'm proud to say the Gulf of Mexico has recently populated such a group and is already getting to work fleshing out what its program will look like. These Young Fishermen Development Programs will be paramount; they will be the ones putting in the long hours on the ground with our young people and educators to put these plans into action. To achieve long-term viability for the industry, the professionalization of the industry requires support and appropriations. For example, a Bill referred to this Committee last year, the Young Fishermen's Development Act,/6 would provide grants to support new and established local and regional training programs for young fishermen. Such programs would provide vocational training for our young people in the U.S and include fisheries as a desirable career path.
Rewriting of USCG Safety Requirements - Making Them Region Specific
The United States Coast Guard Alternative Safety Compliance Program for Commercial Fishing Vessels began with the best of intentions, however, its one-size-fits-all approach to safety for commercial fishing vessels across the nation has led to protocols which many times do not address the true nature of the safety concerns in a particular region. In the Gulf of Mexico, it is not vessels sinking which cause the bulk of our fatalities. Therefore a program, like the Alternative Safety Compliance Program, which is aimed at ensuring the utmost structural integrity of the vessel to prevent sinking, is not what is needed to save lives in the Gulf region. The main driver of fatalities in the Gulf of Mexico is individual instances of one crew member falling overboard. Due to the relatively small crew size on Gulf vessels (usually 1-4 crew on board); an individual falling overboard often goes unseen, leading to a considerable amount of time passing before the search begins. If the intent is really to save lives of commercial fishermen, the current Alternative Safety Compliance Program should be repealed and replaced by a program with a regional approach tailored to addressing the drivers of fatality in each region. In the Gulf of Mexico, such a regional program could go a long way to reducing fatalities, i.e. improving safety at sea, by focusing on life jackets that crew will realistically wear while working, swimming skills and emergency shut offs for the winch - rather than costly standards for the physical integrity of vessel. Regional working groups, which allow and encourage substantial participation by commercial fishermen, should be formed with the mission of rewriting the USCG Alternative Safety Compliance Program for Commercial Fishing Vessels in order to address the drivers of fatalities unique to each region in an attempt to earnestly save the lives of those we love.
Reduce the hypoxic zone (dead zone) in the Gulf of Mexico
Hypoxia, or oxygen depletion, is an environmental phenomenon where the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water column decreases to a level that can no longer support living aquatic organisms. The formation of hypoxic zones may be rapid but once formed may persist for months or longer. For marine organisms this may result in movement from the affected area, reduced growth rates, or large-scale mortality events (e.g., fish kills) that impairs sustainable fisheries and reduces primary production and health of marine ecosystems. Hypoxia can occur naturally or result from human activities and hypoxic zones are becoming more common worldwide. The Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone is the largest human caused dead zone in the United States and the second largest in the world. The maximum extent of this dead zone encompassed 8,500 square miles in 2002 and has averaged 5,300 square miles over the last 30 years. The primary cause is the discharge of nutrient enriched freshwater from the Mississippi River from approximately 41% of the land area of the contiguous United States, ranging as far west as Idaho, north to Canada, and east into New York State. These nutrient enriched waters of the Mississippi River flow directly into the northern Gulf of Mexico.
Nutrient concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in the Mississippi River discharge have increased dramatically in recent decades and are caused primarily by the increased use of fertilizer to support agricultural activities. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, this nutrient enrichment leads to phytoplankton blooms and eventually hypoxic zones as the decomposing marine life depletes the available oxygen. This reoccurring dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico negatively affects marine ecosystems and the fisherman that depend upon the living resources in this area for their livelihood and as a source of recreation and food production for the nation. Meaningful action to reduce both point and non-point nutrient inflows into the Gulf of Mexico is necessary to promote conservation and sustained benefits of this region to the nation in terms of economic activities, continuance of traditional fishing engagement, and as an important food source for the nation.
Here again, I realize that farmers have felt the detrimental economic impacts from Covid-19 just as fishermen have. Regulations requiring large scale action by farmers to reduce runoff would exacerbate the current economic strain in the agricultural industry. Therefore, a carrot would be much better served than a stick. Here again is an opportunity to provide a possible (temporary) tax incentive, i.e. stimulus, to farmers who can show investment in capital expenditure projects which have a reasonable expectation of resulting in reduced nutrient rich runoff. This creates a win-win for both farmers and fishermen. I truly believe that if we can ever get the ball rolling in a meaningful way, we will begin to turn the tide on nutrient runoff and create even greater sustainability for both our farmers and our fishermen.
No Further Areas Closed to Commercial Fishing Outside the Purview of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
Around the nation, commercial fishermen have lost access to many areas that they have traditionally fished. Reducing the fishing grounds accessible to our fishermen through area closures which occur outside the Regional Fishery Management Process is an impediment that creates an undue burden on domestic seafood production. Yet, whether the intended benefits of these area closures are met often remains unclear years after the closures are established. In my opinion, any closure of federal waters to fishing (or regulations which have the same effect as fishing closures, such as prohibitions on the of use specific fishing gear types in an area or rules regarding transit of these areas) should take place through the rigorous scientific process carried out under the purview of the Regional Fishery Management Councils and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as opposed to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act or the Antiquities Act. This would ensure that due consideration of affected fisheries be given in evaluating if those fisheries can be sustainably harvested and managed in a manner that does not compromise the broader objectives of the spatially protected area.

5 Because of a loophole in the agency's administration of the law, seafood markets do not have to comply with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) requirements for seafood unless that market purchases more than $230,000 worth of fresh or frozen agricultural produce in a calendar year. This means that labeling rules only really apply in grocery stores. As the USDA explains on its website "Retail firms such as fish markets and butcher shops, as well as small stores that do not sale the threshold amount of fresh produce, are exempt from country of origin labeling requirements."

Full text: The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued the following news release on June 11:
Yesterday, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in response to the Executive Order "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" the White House issued on May 07, 2020.
The letter requests that the U.S. Department of Commerce strongly consider the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) as a vital partner in enacting the Executive Order's critical goals to bolster the nation's seafood and aquaculture industry.
Florida's seafood industry, generating $3.2 billion annually and supporting more than 76,000 jobs, has incurred significant economic losses due to COVID-19, according to a UF/IFAS impact assessment.
Commissioner Fried notes that FDACS actively supports the seafood industry and urges the U.S. Department of Commerce and Congress to take bold action to help advance offshore aquaculture to benefit American farmers recovering from the pandemic's effects.
* * *
The Honorable Wilbur Ross
Secretary
U.S. Department of Commerce
1401 Constitution Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20230
Dear Secretary Ross,
I write to you today as Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture on behalf of Florida's robust and diverse seafood and aquaculture industries, and in response to the Executive Order (EO) "Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth" issued by the White House on May 7, 2020.
In line with the Executive Order's objectives, Florida's seafood industry, which generates $3.2 billion annually and supports more than 76,000 jobs, actively supports the bolstering of the national seafood sector by increasing competitiveness through critical international seafood trade reform and enhancing protection of the nation's sustainably managed fisheries. As Florida's lead aquaculture agency, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) strongly urges the U.S. Department of Commerce to consider Florida as a vital partner in enacting these critical goals.
As one of the fastest growing agribusinesses in the world, aquaculture is rapidly expanding in both diversity and scale to meet the growing demand for safe, affordable, and nutritious seafood commodities. While the U.S. has been a leader in technological innovations and production research, our country has experienced virtually none of the economic benefits due to cumbersome and uncertain federal policies, or the lack thereof.
It is evident through the issuance of this EO and the introduction of the bipartisan Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture Act (H.R.6191), that the federal government is willing to make the necessary policy changes and investments to increase domestic aquaculture production. As the U.S. Department of Commerce takes steps to enact Sections 6, 7, and 9 of this EO, I encourage you to consider the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services as a potential partner in supporting permitting procedures, ready to seize the development opportunities forthcoming.
Florida is uniquely positioned to advance an environmentally sustainable offshore aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic Ocean. Our state has a proven and streamlined submerged-lands leasing process for marine aquaculture that has functioned for decades, and to date oversees 1,304 aquaculture lease parcels covering 3,918 acres of state waters. As acknowledged in the EO, security of tenure for a minimum of ten years -- already well established in Florida law -- is essential for aquaculture leaseholders to secure capital and investor confidence for business development.
Our Department has been actively engaged at the state level in developing the offshore aquaculture industry similarly aligned with the EO objectives for several years. In partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Center for Coastal Ocean Science (NOAA NCCOS), the Offshore Aquaculture Spatial Planning in Florida project has identified several large areas in the Gulf of Mexico ideal for the development of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas in state and federal waters off of Florida's coast, critical for the development of this offshore industry.
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has a long and established history of working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to develop, update, and manage permits for marine aquaculture. Not only do we maintain a unique general permit for shellfish and live rock aquaculture in state waters, but we are also actively working to modify this permit to allow seaweed farms to be sited in state waters. However, our permit modification review and consultation process has now been underway for more than one year with no significant progress from NOAA nor USACE. This resource-intensive and time-consuming permitting process is difficult for state agencies with extensive expertise to navigate, much less individual businesses.
Our experiences underscore the desperate need for transparent and streamlined federal permitting mechanisms. I cannot overstate the need for a "One Federal Decision" process for aquaculture permitting and timely interagency review of both state and public permit requests.
I am formally requesting that the U.S. Department of Commerce consider Florida when designating Aquaculture Opportunity Areas within the next year. Our proactive work with NOAA NCCOS and distinctive regulatory framework would allow us to proceed with the Environmental Impact Statement process expeditiously. We also actively support the inclusion of state waters as the USACE works to develop nationwide permits for finfish and seaweed aquaculture, as stated in Section 6, subparts (b)(ii) and (iv) of the EO.
I urge the U.S. Department of Commerce and Congress to take bold action to enact common-sense policies that will advance sustainable offshore aquaculture and benefit American farmers, the jobs they support, and the families they feed. As Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture, our Department and Division of Aquaculture stand ready to assist with these new efforts.
Sincerely,
Nicole "Nikki" Fried
Florida Commissioner of Agriculture

Full text: Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, issued the following news release on May 28:
Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet approved a 17,080-acre land acquisition within the Dickerson Bay/ Bald Point Florida Forever project from The Nature Conservancy. The acquisition of this property, also known as The Bluffs, provides a permanent means of protecting and restoring the estuaries that recreational and commercial fishers rely on for finfish and shellfish species that are the economic lifeblood of the region.
Governor DeSantis said, "Conserving lands for future generations is vital to our state's environmental heritage. Conserving large tracts of land like The Bluffs will ensure environmental protection, as well as economic and recreational opportunities for our residents and visitors, now and into the future. I applaud DEP and The Nature Conservancy for their hard work in finalizing this acquisition of more than 17,000 acres that will conserve over two miles of frontage on the Gulf of Mexico, six miles of frontage on Ochlockonee Bay, and eight and a half miles of frontage on the Ochlockonee River."
Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein said, "I would like to thank the Governor and Cabinet for their support of this purchase of the Dickerson property and my profound appreciation for the partnership of The Nature Conservancy that has made the unique and critical acquisition possible. This acquisition will provide increased protection of water quality and natural functions of this important land, water and wetland ecosystem in Florida's Panhandle and further our state's coastal resiliency efforts along the Gulf of Mexico."
Temperince Morgan, Executive Director, The Nature Conservancy said, "The Nature Conservancy in Florida has worked for more than 10 years to protect the 17,000+ acre Dickerson Bay property in Wakulla and Franklin counties and due to its immense conservation value, we have pledged over $2 million to help secure this win. Today we congratulate Governor DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet for voting to support the acquisition of this precious jewel for the citizens of Florida. Investment of Florida Forever funds in these communities will secure a linchpin for vital habitat in the Big Bend that connects state and federal lands in a ribbon of conservation. It also offers the potential for ecotourism, unprecedented public access to nature-based recreation, and the economic development related to these activities in the region. During these challenging times, people are increasingly aware of how vital nature is to our physical, mental and emotional health. It is encouraging that the Governor and Cabinet recognize the importance of conservation to the health of our great state."
Jim McCarthy, President, North Florida Land Trust said, "This is a wonderful project and is a huge win for North Florida. It supports the fishing and tourism economies. It protects incredibly important wildlife and their habitat as well as providing for resiliency. The educational programming opportunities here are enormous. The people who fish, boat, sail, swim, hike, bike will enjoy it for generations to come. It is truly a wonderful part of old Florida that is being protected forever. We commend the Governor and Cabinet for taking this action."
Will Abberger, Vice President, Trust for Public Land said, "In 1999, The Trust for Public Land was proud to work with the State of Florida to permanently protect the land that that is now Bald Point State Park. This long-sought acquisition fits the puzzle pieces together for the protection of these incredible aquatic and upland natural resources, achieving fish and wildlife habitat protection and providing new public recreational opportunities on a truly landscape scale."
Julie Wraithmell, Director, Audubon Florida said, "This acquisition is a key part of the Panhandle landscape, with iconic habitat and vulnerable wildlife. Conservationists in the Panhandle have long considered The Bluffs critical to the long-term ecological health of the region. What a victory to see it protected in perpetuity, for generations of people and wildlife alike. This is what Florida Forever is truly about--protecting what makes our state special, our quality of life, and the bedrock foundation of our state's economy."
Erin Albury, Director, Florida Forest Service said, "The tract will increase the state forest's ecological value, provide public access and recreational opportunities, as well as benefit from multiple-use management activities consistent with the management plan."
Paul J. Thorpe, Deputy Director, Resource Management Division said, "The proposed acquisition of The Bluffs of St. Teresa property will help protect water quality and water resources, and it will protect floodplain functions - an important factor in minimizing future flood risk and protecting wetlands and natural hydrology. As such, this acquisition will complement and further the District's efforts to protect and restore watershed resources through the Apalachicola River and Bay and Ochlockonee River and Bay SWIM plans."
Cainnon Gregg, Florida Shellfish Aquaculture Association said, "The Florida Shellfish Aquaculture Association strongly supports the acquisition of the Dickerson Bay/Bald Point property using Florida Forever funding. The property holds significant environmental resources and economic development opportunities for citizens of Florida, and is greatly supportive of a thriving and growing aquaculture industry in Wakulla and Franklin Counties. Public ownership and protection of the Dickerson Bay/Bald Point property will help ensure that the waters of the Apalachee Bay and Apalachicola Bay will continue to be of a quality to provide robust fisheries for the economic foundation of the region."
Kent L. Wimmer, Senior Representative, Defenders of Wildlife Northwest Florida said, "Defenders of Wildlife strongly supports the Ochlockonee Timberlands Florida Forever Acquisition Project as it protects lands essential to the protecting the military missions of Tyndall Air Force Base which use the airspace above these lands. Additionally, this acquisition will protect the estuaries of Dickerson, Levy and Ochlockonee bays by conserving the adjacent uplands. These bays provide foraging habitat for endangered sea turtles, specifically, juvenile Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, and other state or globally rare birds, such as wood storks and bald eagles, and sea turtles. The uplands surrounding the three bays are an intricate mosaic of lakes, depression marshes, mesic flatwoods, that support populations of rare animals such as Sherman's fox squirrel and gopher tortoise, scrubby flatwoods, and scrub connected with the marine communities by numerous tidal creeks, salt flats, and salt marshes."

WASHINGTON, March 11 -- Jim Parsons, president of the National Aquaculture Association, Tallahassee, Florida, has issued a public comment on the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposed rule entitled "Migratory Bird Permits: Management of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) throughout the United States". The comment was written on March 9, and posted on March 10, 2020:
* * *
Please accept the following comments from the National Aquaculture Association (NAA)/1 relative to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning management of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the United States.
The NAA strongly supports the re-establishment of an Aquaculture Depredation Order (AQDO) as a reasonable and effective means for farmers utilizing outdoor production facilities, primarily ponds or flooded croplands, to deter consumption of their farm-raised fish or crawfish by double-crested cormorants for these reasons:
1. Double-crested cormorant predation of farm-raised fish causes significant crop loss and economic damage.
2. Oversight by two federal agencies, when provided by an AQDO, was effective in protecting double-crested cormorant populations and managing on-farm fish predation.
3. Double-crested cormorant populations increased during the period the AQDO and Public Resource Depredation Order were in effect.
4. The individual permit currently available significantly constrains farm-level control and management prescriptions that could be provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services under an AQDO.
Fish Predation
The double-crested cormorant is a large water bird that feeds mainly on fish and can consume approximately a pound of fish per day. Wires (2104) characterized the double-crested cormorant as being "...the most significant avian predator on fish in North America (page 25)" and noted 4.5-pound adult birds can consume 20 to 25 percent of their body mass daily (.9 to 1.1 pounds). Commercial fish ponds can be stocked at high densities ranging, for example, from 2,000 to 60,000 catfish per acre or 50,000 to almost 200,000 bait fish per acre. These efficient production practices make fish farms highly susceptible to bird predation, particularly by cormorants.
Considerable research has focused on double-crested cormorant predation upon farm-raised catfish in the State of Mississippi because of the size, scale and economic importance of catfish aquaculture. The analyses supported the establishment of an AQDO in 1998 and subsequent refinement of that research has occurred to document crop loss in subsequent years and to support the continuance of an AQDO as a successful management paradigm.
The research focus on Mississippi catfish should not be interpreted to mean farm-raised fish predation is unimportant to the production of baitfish, sportfish, ornamental fish (aquarium or water gardening) or to the stocking of farm-raised bait or sportfish for recreational fishing in other states. Ornamental fish, on a weight basis, may represent a farm-gate value of $20.00 or more per pound. Double-crested cormorants readily prey on colorful ornamental fish and will rapidly consume a pool of tropical ornamental fish before a farmer can react (Sandy Moore, Segrest Farms, personal communication; Craig Watson, Director - University of Florida, Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory, personal communication). A study conducted by US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services demonstrated that losses on ornamental fish farms in central Florida due to fish-eating birds were as high as 30% (Avery et al. 1999). Barras (2007) summarized the variety of birds and types of farm-raised fish consumed by birds, including double-crested cormorants, in the Southern United States. A report entitled, Wildlife Services Program: Information on Activities to Manage Wildlife Damage (GAO 2001) stated:
"Fish-eating birds (e.g., cormorants, herons, egrets, and pelicans) can cause severe damage at aquaculture farms, eating catfish, crawfish, salmon, bass, trout, and ornamental fish. According to a USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) survey of catfish producers from 15 states, 69 percent reported some wildlife-caused losses, with a financial loss of $12.5 million to wildlife predation in 1996 (page 8)."
Glahn and Brugger (1995) developed a bioenergetics model for wintering cormorants in the Mississippi Delta that relied on environmental factors, cormorant abundance, and prey consumption rates to estimate daily fish intake. Results from their model estimated approximately 900 metric tons, 20 million fish per winter, of catfish were consumed annually in 1989-1991 or 4% of the standing crop at a replacement cost of $2 million annually. Dorr et al. (2012) estimated approximately 1,560 metric tons of catfish were consumed annually in 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 representing an annual estimated economic loss of $5.6 million to $12 million. This increase was attributed to greater cormorant abundance in the Delta and subsequent increased foraging days and depredation of higher value fish from food fish ponds. We note that these estimates underestimate the loss to the fish farming community as they apply only to Mississippi and don't include cost of bird management or multiplier effects to on-farm and off-farm economies.
Since those studies, Mississippi farmers have adopted a split-pond production system that reduces pond surface area but increases pond stocking density (Tucker and Kingsbury 2009). To evaluate double-crested cormorant predation upon this new production system, a recent predator-prey bioenergetics model (i.e., quantification of cormorant abundance, distribution, and foraging ecology on catfish aquaculture to estimate the total biomass of catfish consumed) estimated 4.2 and 5 million double-crested cormorant foraging days occurred during winters 2016-2018 with an average of 33% of the bird's diet consisting of catfish, or 558.1 and 739.5 metric tons of catfish consumed by cormorants in winters 2016-2018 (Christie 2019).
Additional economic impact analysis related to the bioenergetics model has been published or is in review for publication (Engle et al. in review; Christie et al. 2020). The authors found fish-eating birds result in additional costs on farms as catfish farmers attempt to scare birds off their ponds. In spite of efforts to scare birds, cormorants still consume farmed fish that result in additional negative economic effects associated with reduced farm revenue. Losses to birds in the absence of double-created cormorant management would be substantially greater. The costs to scare birds and the value of fish losses were found to have increased over time (all values were adjusted for inflation). This research will be reporting:
* Catfish farmers that contributed data to the analyses reported a per-acre cost to scare birds of $285 + $159 per acre, making bird-scaring costs the 5th-greatest cost in catfish production. The greatest components of bird-scaring costs were manpower (39%) and truck expenses (34%). The annualized industry-wide value of lost catfish sales revenue to cormorants averaged $47.2 million, ranging from $25.8 million to $65.4 million, depending upon predation levels in any given year. The combined total of negative direct economic effects of the annualized costs of scaring birds and the value of fish lost to cormorants averaged $64.7 million. Including multiplier effects, the effect on total economic output averaged $70.8 million and on economic value added $85.0 million annually.
* To better evaluate the effect at the farm-level, the negative effects of cormorant predation (both costs to scare cormorants and the additional fish losses) were modeled in 27 farm size/production strategies. Removing the negative effects of cormorant predation improved profitability across all scenarios, with percentage increases in profitability ranging from 4% to 23%, with the greatest percentage improvements observed on the smallest farm scenarios and resulted in all but one of the previously unprofitable farm size/production strategies becoming profitable.
* Improvements in profitability reduce financial risk on catfish farms both by reducing costs of production and providing a greater margin of safety in the event of market price decreases. With lower costs of production, farms remain profitable at lower market prices, reducing market price risk.
* Cormorant predation also has led to increased inefficiencies in the way farms are managed. As stated by one respondent, "We have changed how we manage our entire farm due to birds, not efficiency; we schedule seining of ponds with the greatest bird pressure first; anyone going into town drives by ponds with birds on the way in and comes back a different way."
Unlike other forms of agriculture, losses of catfish to federally protected avian predators such as double-crested cormorants are not covered under federal programs that were created to mitigate some portion of these types of losses. Catfish fall through cracks between the several crop loss programs managed by the USDA Farm Service Agency in terms of coverage for losses due to cormorants: Livestock Indemnity Protection, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-raised Fish Program, and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program.
As mentioned, considerable and intensive analysis has focused on double-crested cormorant induced direct and indirect losses in the State of Mississippi. Recent studies concerning scaup (Aythya spp.) predation on Arkansas baitfish farms can be inferred to estimate potential losses from double-crested cormorants. These estimates are probably low because scaup are somewhat specialized in their diets with various animals from classes Insecta, Malacostraca, and Bivalvia as important foods and may only prefer farm-raised baitfish during cold winters (mean daily temperature of 40 degree F) because of the birds' increased energy demands, prey availability, and ease of capture, or some combination of these (Clements et al. 2020). Based upon a cold winter analysis, (December-February, 2017-2018), Clements et al. (2018) reported as many as 51% of the scaup sampled contained baitfish (i.e., golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas)) and individual scaup can consume about 0.5 pound of fish or over 300 individual golden shiners per day. Based on the number of scaup present on a farm and fish consumption during this winter, losses per acre on ponds containing scaup averaged 37,600 golden shiners (estimated range = 16,600 to 58,700 fish per acre). Although other types of birds also eat farmed fish, the average amount of fish consumed by scaup alone corresponded to losses of about 25% of the fish crop. This percentage varied across baitfish farm ponds, where losses of the fish crop were as low as about 8% and as high as 59%.
Losses of baitfish to avian predators occur despite intensive efforts by baitfish farmers to scare birds from their farms. This study found that baitfish farmers spend approximately $250 per acre each year to attempt to scare avian predators from their farms. Losses of golden shiners eaten by scaup resulted in lost revenue of $50 per acre in a cold winter. The combined economic effect of lost revenue from fish losses and the expense of scaring birds decreased overall profit margins by $251 per acre (years with few birds) to $300 per acre in colder years when birds arrive to feed on baitfish on farms. For the median size of golden shiner farm of 800 acres, this represents economic losses of $200,800 per farm in years with few birds and $240,000 per farm in years with high bird pressure.
In addition to direct predation, double-crested cormorants can transmit: 1) parasitic trematodes into catfish production ponds that infect farm-raised catfish and render the processed fillet unmarketable (Overstreet and Curran 2004; Rosser et al. 2016), 2) parasitic flukes that kill juvenile fish (Griffin et al. 2014), and 3) bacterial pathogens (including a hypervirulent strain of Aeromonas hydrophila) that kill farmed fish, incur treatment costs or slow fish growth and increase production costs (Taylor 1992; Cunningham et al. 2018). The economic effects of these introductions have not yet been quantified or estimated.
Aquaculture Depredation Order
The AQDO represented smart government through collaboration between the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biological experts and the on-farm assistance provided by the US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services (WS). The AQDO allowed commercial freshwater fish producers in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas to take double-crested cormorants when the birds were found committing or about to commit depredation on aquaculture stocks. However, farmers are first required to implement non-lethal techniques as prescribed by WS as a precondition to being permitted to use lethal take. Farms are required to report the number of birds killed during the permit period (Barras and Godwin 2005; Dorr and Fielder 2017). Most of the farms affected are family-owned and located in rural areas. Fish farmers do not perceive the shooting of double-crested cormorants as sport or recreation and must invest considerable labor, equipment (vehicles, propane cannons, pyrotechnics, effigies and other nonlethal devices) and fuel (gasoline/diesel or propane) to deter predation by non-lethal means (Gorenzel et al. 1994). The frank opinion of fish farmers is: "It's just a pain in the ass, and I don't see it getting any better from the all the time I've been out here (page 175)" (King 2013).
Research indicates the AQDO was working as well. Burr (2019) conducted aerial surveys of cormorants using catfish aquaculture versus natural waterbodies in Mississippi from 2015-2017. During the 2015 survey period, catfish producers were allowed to use lethal control against cormorants without a federal permit under the AQDO, in the 2016 surveys, the AQDO was ceased, and only non-lethal means of harassment could be legally used to reduce cormorant presence. During the 2017 survey producers were allowed limited lethal take, under a depredation permit system.
Burr (2019) found that the proportion of cormorants using aquaculture in 2015 was 55%, climbed to 88% in 2016, and was intermediate at 79% in 2017. Burr's findings show lethal control may be influencing how cormorants distribute themselves between the two available foraging options (aquaculture vs. natural water bodies). Removing the AQDO option may have resulted in habituation to non-lethal methods and an overall reduced risk perceived by cormorants resulting in increased use of aquaculture facilities to forage. Arkansas bait fish farmers reported during the 2016 winter a higher proportion of immature double-crested cormorants that were far more difficult to haze using nonlethal techniques (Jamie Anderson, IF Anderson Farms, personal communication).
Population Growth Data from a variety of peer reviewed papers and published sources (Weseloh et al. 2002; Wires and Cuthbert 2006; Adkins et al. 2014; Dorr et al. 2014: Wires 2014; Dorr and Fielder 2017) indicates double-crested cormorant populations in North America have increased during the tenure of the Aquaculture Depredation Order (1998 to 2016) and Public Resource Depredation Order (2003 to 2016). This is exemplified by population trend data from the American Breeding Bird Survey copied and pasted at right/2 which estimated an increase of 93% for the period 1966-2011 (Sauer et al. 2013). Wires (2014) commented "Well over a million cormorants are estimated to reside annually in North America, and a take of 40,000 to 50,000 birds yearly likely represents less than 5 percent of the population. Clearly, the cormorant is currently not in any danger of becoming extinct (pages 275-276)."/3
Overall population expansion has resulted in recolonization to historic locations (Ayers et al. 2019), re-establishment of breeding populations in Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Arkansas, Illinois, Minnesota, Mississippi and Missouri (Wires and Cuthbert 2006), range expansion of birds from northwestern Mexico to Southern California (Adkins et al. 2014) and changing migration and wintering patterns for this growing population as a result of commercial aquaculture in the Southeastern United States (Wires and Cuthbert 2006; King et al. 2010; King et al. 2012). As summarized by summarized by Ayers et al. (2019), "These patterns suggest enormous potential for Double-crested Cormorants to repopulate, recolonize, and establish new colonies in North America (page 10)."
Individual Migratory Bird Depredation Permits Constrain Management Options Currently, fish farmers throughout the country are required to contact WS for technical assistance in the management of depredating wildlife and birds. The WS biologists complete an evaluation (Form 37) that describes the incident and documents recommendations for nonlethal and lethal management options. When lethal take is recommended, the Form 37 is forwarded by the applicant with an application fee to an FWS Regional Office to acquire a Federal Migratory Bird Depredation Permit./4
Farms are required to report the number of birds killed during the permit period. Individual permits have been problematical for farms in that:
1. Insufficient birds are allocated to a farm because the national allocation is insufficient or year-to-year appearance of birds on a farm is quite variable.
2. Individual permits may be issued by FWS regional offices on a seasonal rather than calendar basis.
3. Individual permit provisions currently prohibit the use of lead rifle or pellet ammunition.
4. FWS Regional Offices may prohibit the use of rifles.
5. Individual permit provisions currently prohibit the use of decoys.
6. An AQDO should be expanded to include additional states.
Bird Allocation The National Aquaculture Association requests the re-establishment of the AQDO to provide flexibility by WS biologists and farm managers to respond to year-to-year variations in fish predation by double-crested cormorants. Nearly 18 years of double-crested cormorant management under the AQDO, Public Resource Depredation Order and individual Migratory Bird Depredation Permits have yielded adequate management options for farms and an expanding double-crested cormorant population. Since 2017 when only individual permits were available, farms have experienced inadequate allocation of birds for individual permits and time-consuming delays to amend permits. An 800 water acre Wisconsin baitfish farm was recently allocated two birds and a 1,650 water acres Texas food fish farm was initially allocated 10 birds for six weeks when individual permits became available. Complicating national allocation analysis is the year-to-year variability in double-crested cormorant predation that was accommodated by the AQDO but not with individual permits that include specific allocation limits. Dorr et al. (2012) reported variable year-to-year distribution of double-crested cormorants between interior and river associated roosting sites that resulted in crop losses that varied significantly from year-to-year. Currently, Arkansas and Texas fish farms are reporting little to no double-crested cormorant feeding on some farms while at the same time reporting high densities of birds feeding on other farms. Bird presence is completely unpredictable or explainable from farm-to-farm and year-to-year (Neal Ford Anderson, IF Anderson Farms, personal communication; David Dunn, Dunn's Fish Farm, personal communication; Jim Ekstrom, Ekstrom Enterprises, personal communication; Mike Freeze, Keo Fish Farm, personal communication; Dave Gollon, Gollon Bait and Fish Farm, personal communication).
Seasonal Individual Permits
The National Aquaculture Association requests the re-establishment of the AQDO to avoid challenges posed by individual permits issued on a seasonal rather than calendar year basis by FWS Regional Offices. The expansion of double-crested cormorants into historical and novel locations and the establishment of breeding colonies in historical and novel locations results in year-round farmed fish predation. Seasonal permits limit effective cormorant management of fish predation by the presence of double-crested cormorants throughout a calendar year.
Lead Rifle or Pellet Ammunition
The National Aquaculture Association requests the re-establishment of the AQDO to allow the WS to evaluate and authorize the use of lead rifle and pellet gun ammunition to manage double-crested cormorants or the authorization to use lead rifle or pellet gun ammunition under the existing individual permit. The Environmental Assessment for Issuing Depredation Permits for Double-crested Cormorant Management (FWS 2017) includes an in-depth analysis of the use of lead ammunition for double- crested cormorant management (pages 32-33) noting rifles and pellet guns are used to shoot birds in specific instances (i.e., shooting when mixed species are present, near habitable structures, or when people are present) and that birds downed by firearms are collected and buried as required by permit. The FWS Division of Migratory Bird Management concluded the use of lead rifle or pellet ammunition presents low direct, indirect or cumulative environmental effects because of limited lead use, burial of downed birds, environmental risk is substantially less than that posed by shotgun ammunition, and use of lead rifle or pellet ammunition over water presents a low risk of lead related water quality effects (pages 45-46). These conclusions were reflected in the standard conditions proposed for Migratory Bird Depredation Permits (page 76) which included the use of nontoxic shotgun ammunition but did not require nontoxic rifle or pellet ammunition.
Use of Rifles
The National Aquaculture Association requests the re-establishment of the AQDO to allow the use of rifles as authorized by WS biologists or the addition of rifles as a management tool under the existing individual permit. Currently, rifles are not allowed under individual permits issued by certain FWS Regional Offices. As noted, rifles are effective under specific instances (i.e., shooting when mixed species are present, near structures, or when people are present). And lead rifle ammunition presents low direct, indirect or cumulative environmental effects because of limited lead use, burial of downed birds, environmental risk is substantially less than that posed by shotgun ammunition, and use of lead rifle ammunition over water presents a low risk of lead related water quality effects (FWS 2017).
Use of Decoys
The National Aquaculture Association requests the re-establishment of the AQDO to allow the use of decoys as authorized by WS biologists or the addition of decoys as a management tool under the existing individual permit. The Environmental Assessment for Issuing Depredation Permits for Double-crested Cormorant Management (FWS 2017) did not discuss the use of decoys but did prohibit their use in the standard conditions proposed for Migratory Bird Depredation Permits (page 76). Double-crested cormorant decoys are a valuable tool for on-farm management. As noted in Dorr et al. (2016) in a publication developed to inform wildlife damage management, "Cormorants respond well to both floating and silhouette decoys, which can make shooting more effective and reduce non-target take (page 8)." The use of decoys allows for the removal of individual cormorants that have become habituated to the use of hazing techniques. These habituated individuals act as live decoys, attracting additional cormorants to a facility and their removal actually decreases the overall take of cormorants on an individual facility. The farming community is desirous of being as effective as humanly possible in managing depredating birds and avoiding the killing of non-target birds.
Additional States Should be Added to an Aquaculture Depredation Order The National Aquaculture Association requests that a re-established AQDO encompass all 48 states where pond production of fish or crawfish occurs. The 2018 Census of Aquaculture (USDA 2018) reports 1,450 farms used 32,017 ponds encompassing 142,049 acres to produce fish and 460 farms utilized 94,880 acres of flooded cropland to produce crawfish. Except for Delaware and Nevada, 48 states used ponds or flooded cropland for fish or crawfish production.
Re-Establish the Public Resource Depredation Order
The National Aquaculture Association requests re-establishing the Public Resource Depredation Order to create a science-based population management plan to protect farm-raised fish and crawfish. Doublecrested cormorants breed in the Great Lakes region and in the fall migrate to the Southeastern United States to overwinter and prey on farmed and wild fish (King et al. 2012; Wires 2014; Craig et al. 2016; FWS 2017). As already noted, the number of double-crested cormorants is increasing and birds are, or will be as the population continues to expand, occupying or colonizing historic or novel locations as migrants or residents. An integrated bird management plan is necessary for migratory or resident breeding colonies and populations to reduce bird-human conflict much as was demonstrated by the successful 13-year, concurrent Aquaculture and Public Resource Depredation Orders.
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to proposed rulemaking and the potential expansion of cormorant management options for the US aquaculture community and public agencies. Please do not hesitate to contact us for copies of cited references.
Sincerely,
Jim Parsons
President

Full text: With a deadline to voice opposition looming, Sarasota city commissioners agreed late Monday to send a letter that condemns a controversial precedent-setting fish farm planned for waters off the coast of Sarasota to the federal regulators who will decide whether to authorize it.
Commissioners have a "strong and formal opposition" to a pilot project by Kampachi Farms that plans to anchor a chain-link mesh pen offshore of Southwest Florida, according to a draft letter addressed to Kip Tyler, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project aims to raise 20,000 almaco jack about 45 miles southwest of Sarasota County.
As part of the EPA's permitting process to determine if discharges from the fish will adversely affect the water, the federal agency had been collecting feedback. The deadline to submit formal comments is Tuesday.
The letter, drafted by Mayor Jen Ahearn-Koch, will also be sent to Sarasota County commissioners and Mote Marine Laboratory, which would provide fingerling almaco jack spawned and raised at its land-based Mote Aquaculture Research Park.
The letter, signed by Ahearn-Koch, expresses concerns that the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorous would affect waters known for harmful algal blooms. Citing the Gulf's sensitivity to red tide, the letter goes on to say that commissioners further believe that adding those discharges to "our warm Gulf waters is too risky and dangerous, even on a trial basis."
As part of the farm's monitoring requirements, Kampachi must test monthly for nitrogen and phosphorus levels, among other discharges near the net pen. The EPA has also said that the project, dubbed Velella Epsilon, won't have a detrimental environmental impact.
The red tide outbreak in 2018 left Florida's coastlines devastated — affecting quality of life of residents, tourists and the economic vitality of Sarasota's tourism and related businesses, the letter says.
"As elected officials, we must protect the health, welfare and safety of our constituents," Ahearn-Koch wrote in the letter.
Although commissioners generally support the pursuit of aquaculture, it "objects to the experimental nature of the Kampachi Farms project."

Full text: SARASOTA – Supporters and opponents of a potential precedent-setting fish farm planned for federally controlled waters off the coast of Sarasota made their cases Tuesday to federal regulators who will decide whether to authorize it.
Their comments came during a hearing at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's permitting process to determine if discharges from the fish will adversely affect the water.
Opponents of the proposal by a Hawaii-based company to anchor a chain-link mesh pen offshore of Southwest Florida to raise 20,000 almaco jack about 45 miles southwest of Sarasota, decried recent environmental scars on coastal Florida.
They also expressed concerns that the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorous would affect waters known for harmful algal blooms.
Meanwhile, proponents argued that many of the criticisms of offshore fish farming were based on outdated practices that were abandoned years ago.
Supporters also argued that the proposal would be a vital first step for much-needed data for the future of offshore aquaculture in the United States.
Kampachi Farms' pilot project, dubbed Velella Epsilon, is expected to produce about 88,000 pounds of fish.
Sixty people pre-registered to comment at the hearing and well over 120 people came to listen.
Pauleen Home, a resident of Lakewood Ranch, spoke against the pilot project.
Home said that although the farm has made impressive strides in aquaculture farming and research in the colder waters off the coast of Hawaii, the floating net pen is the "wrong solution" for the shallower, warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Temperatures can reach up to 90 degrees in the summertime.
Kavan Main is manager for the Marine and freshwater aquaculture research program at Mote and has led the nonprofit's aquaculture research programs since 2001. Main did not speak on behalf of Mote and said that much of the criticism of aquaculture is based on outdated practices that were abandoned years ago. Main also said that best management practices have been developed to improve aquaculture.
"Time is of the essence in developing U.S marine aquaculture," Main said. "We are far behind other countries. We need to do this in a manner that is both environmentally sustainable and provides info that we need."
As part of the farm's monitoring requirements, Kampachi must test monthly for nitrogen and phosphorus levels, among other discharges near the net. As part of the EPA's Ocean Discharge Criteria for the farm, the project won't have a detrimental environmental impact.
The farm will have graduate students from the University of Miami monitoring the waters surrounding the farm, Neil Sims, CEO of Kampachi Farms told the Naples Daily news last week.
In addition to Florida Sea Grant, Sarasota's Mote Marine Laboratory is a stakeholder in the project. Mote will provide fingerling almaco jack spawned and raised at its land-based Mote Aquaculture Research Park for the Kampachi demonstration project.
The net pen would be 17 meters in diameter and 7meters deep, and located 40 meters below the surface. It would be anchored to the bottom and tended by a feed barge that would be tethered to the side of the net pen.
The fish would grow to market size within 12months.
At the hearing, Justin Bloom, the founder and board member of the Suncoast Waterkeeper, took a more even-handed criticisms of the project.
Although the nonprofit recognized the need for off-shore aquaculture and for a reliable source of healthy seafood and saw the potential for such facilities, he said that "federal law calls for a more thorough review and analysis in the form of a full environmental impact study of the potential environmental and socio-economic impacts from the project."
Dennis Peters, Velella Epsilon and permit coordinator for Kampachi Farms, said that he was not surprised by the comments expressed on Tuesday — most of it centering on the possibility of additional fish farming projects in the Gulf.
Peters noted any additional aquaculture venture would be subject for additional permits.
"I think a lot of them were confused and were focusing on the commercial potential verses the real benefits of the data that can be provided through the pilot project," Peters said. "It's not a foregone conclusion to say that this is going to go."
Should the EPA greenlight the project, Kampachi Farms must also get permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because of the need to anchor in federal waters.
Mary Walker, the EPA's regional administrator, will make a determination after the Feb. 4 comment deadline. If her determination is substantially unchanged, Walker will notify anyone who has submitted written comments.
Anyone who filed comments on the draft permit or participated in the public hearing can file an appeal within 30 days after Walker files the notice.
Before the hearing, more than a dozen demonstrators stood at the corner of Ken Thompson and John Ringling Parkways and along the sidewalks.
Most had environmental concerns, contending that chemicals flowing out of the pen could disrupt and pollute the natural ecosystem.
Paul Zajicek, the executive director of the National Aquaculture Association, joined the protesters, hoping to learn and listen to their concerns.
Zajicek noted that since the 1970s, the EPA has held authority to regulate discharges from fish farms under several iterations of the Clean Water Act. More recently, environmental groups sought EPA re-evaluation of the Clean Water Act standards applied to aquaculture.
Zajicek said that the evidence is not yet conclusive on whether or not an offshore fish farm will cause red tide. That will be determined after the pilot project is completed, he said.
Aquaculture farmers, like Kampachi Farms, have been completely transparent and are "just as concerned as they are" about nutrient pollution and other environmental concerns, Zajicek said.

Full text: A proposed finfish farm in federally controlled waters will be in the spotlight during a public hearing in Sarasota on Jan. 28. The farm will be the first of its kind in the Gulf of Mexico and discussions are expected to revolve around environmental concerns.
The hearing is part of the Environmental Protection Agency's permitting process to determine if discharges from the fish will adversely affect the water.
"America imports over 90% of seafood that we eat," said Neil Sims, CEO of Kampachi Farms. "If folks are really concerned about environmental issues, then they should be focused on growing seafood locally rather than exporting our ecological footprint."
Kampachi Farms is the Hawaii-based company proposing the finfish farm dubbed Velella Epsilon. The project is proposed as a pilot program to test the viability of fish farms in the Gulf. A single net pen will raise about 20,000 almaco jack roughly 45 miles southwest of Sarasota. The farm is expected to produce about 88,000 pounds of fish.
"The hearing will begin with a brief presentation by the EPA and a neutral process facilitator, followed by oral comments from interested persons," the EPA's public notice of the hearing says.
Among the environmental concerns are the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus into waters known to harbor harmful algal blooms.
"The environment and community would be paying a direct price from toxins and pollution released into the waters," said Rosanna Marie Neil, policy director for the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance. "I believe it would make harmful algal blooms worse as there could be higher amounts of nitrogen released into the ocean and that can make red tide worse."
As part of the farm's monitoring requirements, Kampachi must test monthly for nitrogen and phosphorus levels, among other discharges, near the net. As part of the EPA's Ocean Discharge Criteria for the farm, the agency "determined that sufficient information exists to conclude that the discharge from the facility would not cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment ... "
"There is no doubt that it would exacerbate red tide and algal bloom," said Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner for Friends of the Earth. "A lot of reason for the blooms is increased nutrients in water such as agricultural runoff, mostly human caused. Sometimes algal blooms can be caused naturally, but they're exacerbated by industrial uses."
The farm will have graduate students from the University of Miami monitoring the waters surrounding the farm, Sims said.
"Not only will there be no significant impact, it won't even be detectable," Sims said of the discharges coming from the net pen. "We have monitoring around our farms here in Kona. We produce 500 tons of fish in a year, and you couldn't tell the difference between up current and down current of the pens."
While the public hearing in Sarasota is based on pollution discharges from the pilot program, there is concern among some that the net pen will not be able to weather the storms that roll through the Gulf.
"The Gulf of Mexico gets looked at a lot as calm, but because of its shallowness, it ends up becoming a washing machine," Jason DeLaCruz said. "It can sometimes be far rougher than people give it credit for."
DeLaCruz founded Wild Seafood Company in Johns Pass near St. Petersburg. He's in the wholesale business and runs a bait and tackle shop on the pass. He's worried Kampachi's net pen will be in water too shallow for it to withstand the Gulf's more violent weather systems.
"(The project) may be a great thing," he said. "We certainly need more ways to feed people, but the ocean will be the answer in the long term. Maybe the answer is it's just not our coast where the shelf goes super far out to reach deep water."
DeLaCruz and others are concerned that if fish escape from the pen, it could cause genetic problems with wild populations.
"Especially when this happens on a large scale, (escaped fish) can interbreed with wild fish and compromise their genetic integrity," Rosanna Neil said. "They can sometimes create competition for food and they can wreak havoc on the ecosystem because they are not identical to wild fish."
Sims acknowledged that nature is unpredictable.
"We are going to engineer this to be able to withstand the sorts of storms that frequent the Gulf," he said, "but there's no absolute guarantees that anything happens in the water. Working in the ocean is managing risk and from our past experience I think we are comfortable managing around this."
The almaco jack stock going into the pen is of the same native gene pool of those found in the Gulf, Sims said. The parents of the fish to be raised in the pen were collected from Sarasota.
The pen is designed to be submersible to about 50 feet below the surface and move with the waves and currents.
"One of the innovations we are demonstrating with Velella Epsilon is we will have this on a swivel mooring so the pen will move around with the current in an arc rather than being fixed at one point, and that further reduces the potential for any impact," Sims said.
The point of the demonstration pen is to collect information.
"We assure this can grow in a way that has minimal impact," Sims said. "We can only do that if we have a demonstration and people can actually see what the impacts are and the potential (of the farm)."
Ahead of the public hearing, groups are organizing a demonstration against the fish farm project on Tuesday.
"We're hoping to raise awareness, educate and send a message to the EPA," Templeton said. "We're going to show that there is a community opposition and it will not go untested and that people care about what's happening on their coastline."
Demonstration organizers include the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth, Healthy Gulf, Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance, Sierra Club, Suncoast Waterkeeper and others.
The demonstration is from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. at the corner of Ken Thompson and John Ringling Parkways and along the sidewalk. The hearing begins at 5:30 p.m. at the Wave Center, Mote's main laboratory building at 1600 Ken Thompson Parkway.

Full text: A Hawaii-based company is planning an offshore finfish farm in federal waters off the coast of Southwest Florida.
Kampachi Farms has proposed a pilot-scale marine aquaculture facility named Velella Epsilon to be built in the Gulf of Mexico 45 miles south of Sarasota.
"I think there is a pressing global need to expand food production," said Neil Sims, co-founder of Kampachi Farms. "A United Nations high level panel on oceans said one of the five key steps to address the climate crisis is to start to shift from terrestrial agriculture to marine agriculture."
The proposed farm will raise 88,000 pounds of almaco jack fish each year, the same amount caught by commercial fishers in Florida each year. Sims said the Velella Epsilon project will consist of a demonstration pen where the farmed fish will be held. The pen will measure 20 feet deep and 50 feet across. It is able to be submerged about 7 meters, or 20 feet.
"We would hope that if we were to get (a) permit by February or March next year, we will have fish in the water by July or August," Sims said. "It takes a lot of prep and it might be six months after permits."
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued a draft environmental assessment for the project.
"On August 30, 2019, EPA Region 4 provided the public a 30-day comment period for a draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the Kampachi Farms," EPA spokeswoman Dawn Harris Young wrote in an email. "During the 30-day public comment period, EPA received a significant number of comments. The EPA is currently reviewing the comments received and is evaluating the need for a public hearing and potential extension of the public comment period."
Environmental groups have said that the public comment period was not long enough and hope that the EPA opens a public hearing.
"We're watchdogging this closely," said Hallie Templeton, the senior oceans campaigner for the advocacy group Friends of the Earth. "We have urged the EPA to hold public input; we'll see what happens. There has been written comment, but we have not heard anything out of the agency."
Templeton said the farm poses a risk to the environment through the discharge of excess nutrients into the Gulf and other concerns.
"Net pens are free flowing exchange, and anything in a net pen can just leech into surrounding waterway," she said. "Fish waste and excess fish feed go into existing environment. There's no way that could be a win, it could not be beneficial. They say could be diluted, but dilution is not solution to the pollution."
Sims said there has been monitoring around Kampachi's other offshore pens that show no impact on water quality between up current and down current.
"Nutrients are rapidly assimilated into the ecosystem," he said. "The red tide issue found in Florida is usually very close to shore, and there's a lot of nutrients running off land. That's part of why we are doing this 40 miles offshore where there is good water exchange."
A large Florida red tide bloom caused massive fish kills and respiratory irritations last year and a smaller bloom is currently on the coast of Southwest Florida.
The EPA's draft assessment noted Florida's red tides, and acknowledged excess nutrients from fish farms can promote growth, but says, "(the) permit is being issued with conditions to monitor the discharge and protect water quality."
Kampachi's other Velella projects have all been monitored and were sort of test runs leading up to a larger scale operation, Sims said. After the fish pen in the Gulf is built, Sims hopes to move the company forward, but this worries environmentalists.
"The biggest thing I take issue with is calling this a pilot project," said Marianne Cufone, an environmental attorney and executive director of Recirculating Farms. "I get it's meant to be a test for open fish farming in (the) gulf, but the volume of fish is appalling for a pilot project, it's more like industrial farming."
Cufone said she doesn't understand how there could be no impact with a large operation, and Templeton expressed concerns that moving forward with Velella Epsilon would open the door for larger farms.
Because there is not any fish farming going on in the United States' federal waterways, Templeton said, "this is prying open the door for the industry."
Cufone said she and others are part of a lawsuit challenging NOAA to put regulations in place and she expects to have arguments in January.
"This is meant to be a tester for future industrial-scale projects," she said. "It's not a secret this project is meant to open the door to fish farms in the Gulf of Mexico."
Sims said this project is "about nurturing what we want out of the ocean and figuring out how to do this."
"We would expect that going forward any commercial project will have monitoring requirements," he said. "We think that it's important to share that info with the public."
To Sims, offshore aquaculture is an opportunity.
"We are scientists and conservationists," he said. "There is an economic incentive to drive the ecological imperative: We need to be getting more food from the sea."

Full text: The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued the following testimony by Commissioner Nicole "Nikki" Fried regarding the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, in advance of the committee's hearing on sustainable offshore aquaculture:
In Florida, aquaculture is a $77 million industry, with over 700 aquaculture leases covering 2,700 submerged acres; the industry produces over 1,500 varieties of fish, plants, crustaceans, mollusks, corals, reptiles, and other marine products for food and non-food markets. Florida is one of the nation's top states for fresh seafood production, supporting 14,000 jobs. Florida also ranks 4th in the nation for shellfish production, with more than ten certified shellfish processing facilities in the state.
Commissioner Fried's testimony can be read in full below, and was also shared on Twitter.
Statement of the Honorable Nicole "Nikki" FriedU.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and TransportationHearing: Feeding America: Making SustainableOffshore Aquaculture a RealityOctober 16, 2019
"Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and members of the Committee, thank you for convening this important hearing to discuss sustainable offshore aquaculture and the need for streamlined federal regulations to support this developing industry and ultimately, our nation's food security.
"Agriculture is Florida's second largest industry, with an economic impact of $132 billion in our state. Our 47,000 farms support two million workers and export $4 billion in commodities to 164 nations - feeding our neighbors, our communities, and the world. Aquaculture is Florida's most diverse agribusiness with over 1,000 aquaculturists producing the greatest variety of aquatic species in the nation, with an estimated 1,500 species or varieties of food and aquarium fish, shellfish, aquatic plants, mollusks, crustaceans, and reptiles grown in the state.
"In addition to the growth of this industry in Florida, aquaculture around the globe continues to increase in scale and diversity in order to meet our growing population's need for safe, affordable, and healthy protein. While the offshore food fish sector remains only a small fraction of all aquaculture production in the U.S., the nation's seafood trade deficit continues to grow. The production of domestic aquaculture products is critical for the nation's food security and economy.
"While offshore aquaculture has been critiqued for environmental impacts in past decades, significant technological and scientific innovations have made it possible for these farms to operate with minimal risk to the environment. Advances in fish husbandry, feed composition and genetics, along with drastically improved cage engineering, have now sufficiently addressed the negative perceptions of offshore aquaculture that have prohibited development of the nation's industry in the past. Through proper facility siting and the application of modern, responsible production methods, the U.S. can become a model for sustainable aquaculture production and promote the development of a responsible offshore aquaculture industry that will prove itself as a reliable source of domestic protein and as a good steward of the marine environment.
"However, for offshore aquaculture to develop, a clearly outlined federal permitting process and framework is necessary. For years, aquaculture companies have sought to bring farms and jobs to the U.S., but are unable to persist through the duplicative, overly complicated, and costly permitting process. Commercial companies have reported spending nearly five years and $1 million preparing for and completing applications without ever being granted a permit and have ultimately developed in other nations.
"The offshore aquaculture industry will continue to grow around the world in the coming decades - the only question is, will the U.S. have a role in this burgeoning, sustainable seafood industry? The U.S. and particularly Florida are uniquely positioned to provide a streamlined and environmentally-sustainable regulatory climate for offshore aquaculture, but not until federal permitting barriers are addressed.
"In my capacity as Florida's 12th Commissioner of Agriculture, where our Department assists in the development of aquaculture and regulates aquafarms through our Division of Aquaculture, I bring these issues before you today. As Florida's aquaculture industry continues to grow, so does the need for streamlined federal policies for offshore aquaculture to thrive. Today's hearing is an important step, helping shine a light on this developing industry and the critical role federal policies play in either hindering or encouraging its continued growth.
"I hope that this Committee, the Congress, and our federal agencies will work together to enact common-sense policies to advance sustainable offshore aquaculture to the benefit of American farmers, the jobs they support, and the families they feed. As Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture, our Department and Division of Aquaculture stand ready to assist in this effort."

Full text: Targeted News Service
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 -- The Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report (S.Rpt. 116-127) on legislation (S. 2584) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, science and related agencies for the fiscal ending Sept. 30, 2020. The report was advanced by Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, on Sept. 26.
State Management for Recreational Red Snapper.--The Committee commends the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council for approving "Reef Fish Amendment 50: State Management for Recreational Red Snapper," and in so doing delegating management authority of the private angling component for recreational red snapper fishing to each Gulf State. The Committee urges the Department to approve this measure and believes successful implementation should be a top priority for NMFS. Therefore, within the amount provided for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and Assessments, the Committee provides $5,000,000 for NMFS to continue to deliver technical support to the Gulf States to ensure successful implementation by each State.
Additionally, the Committee directs NMFS to continue to certify and incorporate agency-independent and alternative approaches to stock assessments, including surveys developed by Gulf States, into the agency's stock assessments used for the management of reef fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, all stock assessments used by NMFS for Gulf reef fish should include fishery data collected on artificial reefs, offshore oil platforms, and other offshore fixed energy infrastructure.
South Atlantic Reef Fish.--NMFS shall consider employing the independent and alternative stock assessment strategies directed by the Committee for the Gulf of Mexico to NMFS assessments of reef fish in the South Atlantic. The Committee provides up to $1,500,000 for these activities and notes deficiencies that have plagued reef fish management in the Gulf of Mexico also affect NMFS management of reef fish in the South Atlantic.
For-Hire Electronic Monitoring and Reporting [EM/ER] Implementation.--Within Fisheries Management Programs and Services, the Committee provides $2,650,000 above the fiscal year 2019 level for data collection and catch and effort validation to support timely implementation of electronic logbooks for the federally permitted charter-for-hire sector in the Gulf of Mexico. Further, the Committee provides $1,525,000 above the fiscal year 2019 level within Enforcement for associated State and Federal enforcement activities necessary to ensure successful implementation. Within existing resources, the Committee directs NMFS to continue supporting implementation of EM/ER in the South Atlantic.
Fishing Gear Selectivity Study.--Within funding provided for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and Assessments, NOAA shall consider conducting a multiyear, agency-independent study to evaluate the selectivity and potential bias of different gears used to assess reef fish populations in the South Atlantic region, which should build on recent work being conducted by State agencies on red snapper. Specifically, the study should address whether the use of certain gear by the South Atlantic Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction Survey, such as Chevron traps, fail to adequately sample across age classes of reef fish, including red snapper, due to the different behaviors and habits exhibited by larger and smaller fish within the same or similar species. NOAA is further encouraged to initiate a multiyear, agency-independent study using multiple hooked-gears to sample South Atlantic red snapper for age composition, sexual maturity, and egg production.
Lobster Fishing Gear.--The Committee encourages further collaboration among states, the fishing industry, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations in the development of innovative gear through field trials and preliminary implementation.
Fisheries Information Networks.--Within funding provided for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and Assessments, $24,000,000 is provided for Fisheries Information Networks. The Committee directs NMFS to dedicate the entire increase above the fiscal year 2019 enacted level to support Fisheries Information Systems grants.
Northwest Fisheries Ecosystem Monitoring System.--The Committee recognizes the importance of long-term data series monitoring ocean conditions and ecological indicators. This information is important in management decisions for salmon and other marine species, and to enable advance forecasting capabilities for early detection of ocean conditions known to produce harmful toxins that affect regional fisheries closures. Within funds for Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and Assessments, the Committee provides $500,000 to maintain a time-series monitoring system that includes no less than monthly data collection, analysis, and dissemination of hydrographic and ecological data to inform fishery management on the Northern California Current.
Pacific Bluefin Tuna.--The Committee is concerned by the depleted status of Pacific bluefin tuna. The Committee encourages NMFS to allocate resources in support of the Management Strategy Evaluations for Pacific bluefin tuna and other priority highly migratory species managed under international agreements. Further, the Committee calls upon NMFS to ensure a strong U.S. negotiating position on Pacific bluefin tuna recovery by providing resources to support engagement of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and U.S. stakeholders to ensure continued progress on the international recovery plan.
American Lobster and Jonah Crab Research.--American lobster is the Nation's most valuable single-species fishery, with 2017 landings valued at $552,000,000. The Jonah crab fishery is a rapidly growing alternative fishery that allows American lobster harvesters to adapt to changing ocean conditions. Jonah crab landings were valued at $16,200,000 in 2017 and are expected to grow. Adequate data are required to ensure that State and interstate managers can effectively and sustainably manage these stocks. The Committee provides up to $300,000 within Fisheries Data Collections, Surveys and Assessments to support a cooperative research program to collect biological, fishery, and environmental data for American lobster and Jonah crab using modern technology on commercial fishing vessels.
Fisheries Effort Survey [FES].--The Committee is concerned by reports that the Marine Recreational Information Program FES may be vastly overstating fishing effort. While the FES methodology represents a clear improvement from previous methodologies, the Committee supports the cautious approach to utilizing these estimates advocated by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council Scientific and Statistical Committees. The Committee encourages NMFS to conduct a thorough analysis of the effect of such estimates on stock status and allocation before they are used for stock management.
Data Collection for Recreational Fisheries.--Through passage of the Modern Fish Act (Public Law 115-405), Congress reaffirmed the need for NMFS to develop alternative management approaches and more reliable fishery data collection tools for recreational fisheries. The Committee provides no less than $2,500,000 within Fisheries Data Collection, Surveys and Assessments, to support collaborative programs focused on improving recreational fishery data collection, as articulated in sections 201 and 202 of Public Law 115-405. This funding should focus on assisting States to establish, test, and implement more reliable recreational fishery data collection tools, such as smartphone applications or text messaging supplements. The Committee also looks forward to receiving the studies called for in sections 101 and 103 of Public Law 115- 405.
Atlantic Herring Stock Assessment.--The Committee directs NMFS to ensure that its 2020 Atlantic herring assessment is completed on schedule and to notify the Committee if it anticipates that the deadline will not be met.
Northeast Groundfish Research.--The Committee is concerned about the decline of the Northeast multispecies fishery and the health of fishing stocks in the Gulf of Maine. Within funding provided for Fisheries Ecosystem Science Programs and Services, the Committee provides $2,500,000 for groundfish research, with a focus on the effects of changing climatic conditions and warming waters on the fishery, including stock health and natural mortality. NOAA is further encouraged to prioritize research regarding relative gear efficiency and stock boundaries. Within funding provided, $500,000 shall be obligated to develop methods for improving and increasing utilization of the full range of available fishery dependent data to better inform groundfish stock abundance estimates, including implementation of the recommendations set forth in the New England Fishery Management Council's Fishery Data for Stock Assessment Working Group Report. This funding is intended to support research conducted by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, research conducted separately by, or in collaboration with, outside partners such as higher education institutions or State agencies, and research conducted in cooperation with the fishing industry.
Cooperative Research.--Depleted fish stocks result in significant economic losses to our Nation. At a time when fishing opportunities are constrained by uncertainty in stock assessments and increased access to healthy stocks depends on better data, the Committee believes that maintenance of ongoing monitoring programs, surveys, and improved research is critical. The Committee encourages NMFS to continue to prioritize long-time series surveys that are conducted cooperatively with industry and States. NMFS is additionally encouraged to prioritize studies using video systems deployed in commercial trawl nets for surveys conducted cooperatively with States, industry, and nonprofit institutions that can be validated and incorporated into survey data. NMFS is also encouraged to focus on improved understanding of natural mortality and relative gear efficiency to ensure accurate measures of catchability. Furthermore, the Committee encourages the Northeast Fisheries Science Center to consider prioritizing cooperative research efforts for species that are experiencing shifts in range and population density due to warming waters and other global environmental changes.
Electronic Monitoring and Reporting.--Within Fisheries Ecosystem Science Programs and Services, the Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 level for EM/ER to support the development, testing, and installation of EM/ER technologies across the country. The Committee recognizes that advancements in EM/ER have the potential to cut costs and improve data collection for most U.S. fisheries. NMFS is directed to prioritize EM/ER implementation in fiscal year 2020, and expedite to the fullest extent practicable the transition to full EM/ER. Within the funds provided for these activities, not less than $3,500,000 shall be available, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 3701, for collaborative partnerships that include non-Federal matching funds to implement cost- shared EM/ER programs that support fisheries conservation and management. During the development and implementation of electronic reporting and monitoring programs, NOAA shall consult directly with industry and work through the Fishery Management Councils (established under sections 1851 and 1852 of title 16, United States Code) to develop appropriate cost- sharing arrangements that are commensurate with the ex-vessel value of the fishery.
Furthermore, NMFS shall continue to work in fiscal year 2020 with the charter for-hire recreational fishery fleet in the Gulf of Mexico; the Northeast multispecies groundfish fishery fleet, including small vessels within that fleet; the Maine lobster fleet; and any regional fishery fleet interested in implementing EM/ER technologies to better track information that is currently collected through the use of human observers.
Northeast Multispecies Fishery.--The Committee recognizes that the New England groundfish fisheries management programs continue to present substantial financial challenges to the participants as well as to the economic sustainability of those fisheries and fishing communities. NOAA is directed to fully fund the At-Sea Monitoring costs in the New England groundfish fishery, including sea and shore side infrastructure costs. The Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted amount within Observers and Training for this purpose. Before obligating any of these funds, NOAA shall provide the Committee with a detailed spending plan. Further, NOAA is directed to submit a report to the Committee not less than 180 days after enactment of this act that outlines the current status of electronic monitoring and reporting EM/ER technology for the Northeast multispecies fishery, including an assessment of whether fully operational EM/ER procedures will be ready to replace At-Sea Monitoring on a voluntary basis by September 30, 2021, and if not, an evaluation of the current barriers. The report should also specify methods that will improve the quality and utility of At-Sea Monitoring and electronic monitoring data for purposes of achieving more reliable estimates of stock abundance a $1,000,000 increase above the fiscal year 2019 level.
International Fisheries Management Coordination.--The Committee is aware that conflicting American and Canadian fisheries management measures in the Gulf of Maine have generated concerns from the domestic fishing and lobster industries, due to differing conservation regulations. The Committee encourages NOAA to work with Canadian and state fisheries officials to explore the possibility of developing an agreement that provides for cooperative fisheries management of this unique area.
North Pacific Observer Coverage.--Within Observers and Training, the Committee provides no less than $7,000,000 for the North Pacific Observers Program a $1,000,000 increase above the fiscal year 2019 level.
Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated [IUU] Fishing.--Under Fisheries Management Programs and Services, the Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 amount to combat IUU fishing, including continued execution of the program established under section 539 of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141).
Under Enforcement, an additional $1,600,000 is provided for NMFS to improve its enforcement of the program and strengthen efforts to detect and deter illegally harvested and improperly documented seafood, including working with other U.S., international, and foreign agencies to ensure fair competition for our country's domestic fishermen and safety for American consumers.
Additionally, NOAA is directed to consider how innovative remote sensing technology could help fulfill its IUU mission, including satellite imaging and traceability, and shall consider developing a comprehensive IUU enforcement strategy in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. NOAA may also confer with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center [FLETC] and may contract with FLETC to assess and provide technical assistance to improve NOAA's current law enforcement strategy.
The Committee encourages NOAA to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to improve and expand efforts to identify high-risk shipments and collect critical import data in order to increase enforcement of import restrictions on IUU seafood products and expand investigations of foreign IUU hotspots.
Bycatch Reduction.--The development and implementation of practical bycatch solutions is a priority for U.S. and international fisheries management and protected species conservation. The Committee supports the requested amount for reducing bycatch, of which NMFS is directed to make no less than the fiscal year 2019 amount available for competitive grants to non-Federal researchers working with U.S. fishermen on the development of improved fishing practices and innovative gear technologies.
Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery.--The Committee recognizes the ongoing impacts on the Pacific coast groundfish fishery trawl industry resulting from NMFS's delay in promulgating regulations to collect loan payments for the 2003 fishing vessel and permit buyback program. This delay caused an additional $4,000,000 in interest to accrue, resulting in an estimated $10,000,000 of additional loan payments for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery trawl industry. The Committee notes the implementation of the Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific Act of 2014, section 3095 of Public Law 113-291, which is intended to provide relief related to this legacy issue.
Regional Pilots in Sustainable Aquaculture.--The NMFS Aquaculture Office is directed to continue regional pilot programs for partnerships between the seafood industry and community partners that can develop, validate, and deploy economically and environmentally sustainable aquatic farming techniques and regional business practices to grow domestic seafood production. To maximize the impact of these pilot grants, NMFS is encouraged to give priority consideration to promising but less commercially developed technologies, such as those targeting shellfish, seaweed, and other relative newcomers to the domestic aquaculture industry. The Committee provides $2,500,000 in the NMFS Aquaculture budget for this purpose. This funding is in addition to the laboratory funding for NOAA's fisheries science centers engaged in aquaculture research, which shall be funded at no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.
Aquaculture Activities at Fisheries Science Centers.--The Committee remains concerned about the staffing levels at NMFS fisheries science centers. NOAA is encouraged to grow staffing levels and improve resources and facilities at the Northeast and Northwest Fisheries Science Centers to return staffing levels to those in fiscal year 2010.
Oyster Aquaculture, Research, and Restoration.--Within the funding level provided for NMFS Aquaculture, the Committee provides no less than $5,000,000 to support ongoing research in off-bottom Eastern oyster production in coastal areas, particularly in areas where this method is being exploited for commercial production, including the Gulf of Mexico, and encourages NMFS to dedicate resources to support regional partnerships for genetics, disease, and economic modeling.
In addition, the Committee recognizes that the shellfish farming industry is composed of thousands of small farmers who are unable to fund critical research in the fields of shellfish disease, food safety, warming waters, and ocean acidification. To improve coordination and consistency, the Committee directs NMFS Aquaculture to engage and partner with industry, academic institutions, and States to conduct collaborative research to address the challenges facing this growing industry. Further, NMFS Aquaculture is encouraged to coordinate with the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service [ARS] to leverage and supplement existing ARS shellfish research partnerships.
Salmon Management Activities.--Within the amount provided for Salmon Management activities, the Committee recommends $34,500,000, an increase of $19,000,000 above fiscal year 2019, to enable NOAA, the Pacific States, and tribal communities to begin implementation of the obligations set forth in the 2018 Pacific Salmon Treaty. Before any of these funds may be obligated, NOAA is directed to provide the Committee with a detailed spending plan that is reflective of the funding recommendations produced by the U.S. section of the Pacific Salmon Commission and that strikes an appropriate balance between annual and initial funding needs. In doing so, NOAA is directed to consult with the Pacific States, tribal communities, and other stakeholders. Further, NOAA is encouraged to minimize, to the extent practicable, the amount of funds withheld for administrative expenses.
The Committee also provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 amount for the operation and maintenance of Mitchell Act hatcheries.
Genetic Stock Identification.--The Committee supports continued research and testing of genetic stock identification [GSI] management techniques in the Pacific salmon fishery to meet the dual purpose of protecting declining and the ESA listed stocks, while allowing for sustainable commercial and recreational access to healthy stocks in the wild. NMFS shall continue to support GSI research, including the collection, analysis, and testing of methods that rely on genetics-based data to identify and track the location of federally protected stocks in the wild.
Fishery Councils and Commissions.--The Committee provides $40,247,000 to support the Regional Fishery Management Councils, Interstate Marine Fisheries Commissions, and International Fisheries Commissions. The Committee recognizes the important role that regional management plays in sustaining a balanced ecosystem and healthy fish populations and the advantage that aggregate data can provide in understanding emerging trends across our Nation's fisheries. The Committee directs the Regional Councils and Fisheries Commissions to prioritize research and monitoring of high priority species in the face of changing environmental conditions.
Cooperative Agreements with States.--The Committee rejects the administration's proposal to eliminate funding for cooperative enforcement agreements with States, including execution of Joint Enforcement Agreements. Instead, the Committee provides $18,500,000 for these agreements, which are critical for proper surveillance and enforcement of our nation's fisheries laws.
The Committee is concerned that NMFS's Office of Law Enforcement [OLE] has overly bureaucratized its administration of these agreements, to the point that some longstanding State and Territorial enforcement partners have considered no longer participating. Therefore, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, NMFS OLE is directed to convene a meeting with the State and Territorial enforcement partners to discuss measures that can be taken to reduce administrative and bureaucratic burdens that have been levied upon them. NMFS shall brief the Committee, not later than 180 days after enactment of this act, on the results of the meeting, including what actions will be taken to reduce burdens.
Northeast Lobster Enforcement.--The Committee encourages continued collaboration between States, NOAA, and the U.S. Coast Guard to improve Federal capacity for offshore lobster enforcement in the Northeast. Offshore enforcement and tracking of vessels in the fixed-gear fisheries, such as lobster, is critical to ensure fishing gear is compliant and minimizes negative impacts on whale health.
Horseshoe Crab Survey.--The Committee remains concerned about the ability to estimate the abundance of the mid-Atlantic horseshoe crab population. Adequate data are required to ensure State and interstate managers can effectively manage the stock, which is important to the biomedical and commercial fishing industries, as well as to the ecology of the mid-Atlantic region. The Committee directs NMFS to continue this important survey to generate the data necessary to ensure the mid- Atlantic horseshoe crab stock remains on a sustainable path.
Seafood Reporting.--The United States leads the world in responsibly managed fisheries and aquaculture, and the Committee supports NOAA's activities to inform consumers about our Nation's sustainable fisheries through the agency's FishWatch program. However, the Committee is concerned that the exclusive use or recognition of third-party certifications for seafood sustainability by the Department could have unintended consequences for various domestic fisheries. The Committee acknowledges that some U.S. fisheries voluntarily utilize third-party seafood sustainability certification schemes but believes it is not the Department's role to adopt such certification schemes when doing so could result in the Department arbitrarily influencing the U.S. domestic seafood market. The Committee believes support for third-party certifications is best presented in non-governmental forums. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department not to adopt, use, or promote any third-party certification scheme for seafood sustainability but to instead continue providing consumers with independent and accountable information generated from within the Department.
Economic Impact of Turtle Excluder Devices [TEDs].--The Committee encourages NMFS to continue its efforts to pursue alternatives that would lessen the negative economic impacts of any potential rule requiring all skimmer trawls, pusherhead trawls, and wing nets rigged for fishing to use TEDs in their nets, while still maintaining conservation measures.
Habitat Conservation and Restoration.--The Committee provides $56,885,000 for Habitat Conservation and Restoration activities. The Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted amount to address the Essential Fish Habitat consultation backlog. Within the amount provided, NOAA is encouraged to include funding for the multi-year Habitat Blueprint Focus Area partnership agreements developed under the Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Committee encourages NOAA to include a broader ecosystem-based management philosophy; expand criteria to include recreational species, managed commercial species, and forage species; and prioritize proposals that engage local communities. NOAA should continue to emphasize the value of partnerships when evaluating grant applications.
Oyster Restoration.--The Committee encourages NOAA to work with external partners to research alternative substrates for oyster restoration. NOAA is encouraged to consider survivability as part of the oyster restoration program in the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted amount within Habitat Conservation and Restoration to support oyster restoration in the Chesapeake Bay.
Kelp Forests.--Kelp forests found off the U.S. West Coast are vibrant ecosystems that sustain a variety of unique species. However, these ecosystems face a number of compounding pressures that threaten their survival, including warming waters and overpopulation of purple sea urchins. The Committee encourages NOAA to investigate measures to protect kelp forests, including controlling urchin populations. In addition, the Committee encourages NOAA to support efforts to survey kelp forests.
Regional Biosecurity Plan for Micronesia and Hawaii.--The Committee looks forward to receiving the report required in fiscal year 2019 appropriations act and requires an update for fiscal year 2020.
NOAA OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
The Committee's recommendation provides $531,207,000 for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research [OAR]. OAR programs provide environmental research and technology needed to improve NOAA weather forecasts, climate predictions, and marine services. To accomplish these goals, OAR supports a network of scientists in its Federal research laboratories, universities, and joint institutes and partnership programs.
Committee recommendations are displayed in the following table:

View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/127/1?s=2&r=1
Climate Research.--The Committee rejects OAR's request to eliminate Climate Competitive Research.
Coastal Resilience.--Within funding provided for Climate Competitive Research, NOAA is encouraged to partner with State Sea Grant programs and work to enhance the coastal resilience of remote communities at most risk to natural disasters and chronic events, with a priority given to challenges faced by tribal, indigenous, or economically disadvantaged communities.
Arctic Research.--The Committee provides no less than $6,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2019 level, for Arctic research funded under OAR's Climate Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes and Regional Climate Data and Information.
Weather & Air Chemistry Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.--The Committee adopts the proposed transition of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems office from OAR to the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, as part of the establishment of an unmanned systems operations program. The Committee rejects all other proposed cuts to Weather & Air Chemistry Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes, including the elimination of the Air Resources Laboratory [ARL]. No less than the fiscal year 2019 level is provided for ARL.
Vortex-Southeast [Vortex-SE].--The Southeastern United States commonly experiences devastating tornadoes under variables and conditions that differ considerably from the Midwest, where tornado research has historically been focused. Within funds provided for Weather and Air Chemistry Research Programs, no less than $5,000,000 is provided for OAR to continue collaborating with the National Science Foundation's Vortex-SE initiative to better understand how environmental factors that are characteristic of the Southeastern United States affect the formation, intensity, and storm path of tornadoes for this region.
Hydrologic Modeling Grants.--The Committee recognizes the success of the National Water Model in advancing flood forecasting and predicting other water related hazards. Within funding for the U.S. Weather Research Program, the Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 level for OAR to make grants available for research activities to advance the National Water Model, including improving measurements of snow depth and soil moisture data, and the development of high resolution hydrologic modeling systems to address issues related to floods, drought, water quality, and ecosystem health. Research should include addressing water-related issues in the Southeastern United States, including those relating to agriculture.
Infrasonic Weather Monitoring Research.--Within funding provided for the U.S. Weather Research Program, the Committee provides up to $1,000,000 to support external research opportunities with academic institutions in infrasonic monitoring methods of violent weather. The Committee believes that advanced infrasound signal processing methodologies and studies, deployed through a network of infrasound arrays to detect tornadoes and hurricanes, have the potential to improve forecast accuracy.
Weather Modeling Improvement and Innovation.--Within funding for the U.S. Weather Research Program, the Committee provides no less than $7,000,000 for NOAA to establish the Earth Prediction Innovation Center [EPIC], as authorized by the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-423). The Committee expects that this investment will lead to improvements in NOAA's operational weather forecasting capabilities to protect life and property. Before any funds for EPIC may be obligated, NOAA is directed to provide the Committee with a five-year strategic plan for EPIC that outlines: (1) NOAA's investment strategy for the Center, which is expected to consist of an extramural center approach that is leveraged by intramural investment; and (2) quantitative goals for improving NOAA's operational weather forecasting capabilities.
Phased Array Radar [PAR] Program.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the PAR program and other advanced radar research and development in satisfying the agency's weather and related requirements, and provides an additional $1,500,000 for these purposes. The Committee looks forward to receiving the plan requested in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, (Public Law 116-6).
Radiative Forcing.--The Committee is aware of the National Academies of Sciences' [NAS] development of a research agenda and governance approaches for climate intervention strategies and the participation of NOAA in this process. The Committee looks forward to receiving the results of the NAS study to inform future action.
Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes.--The Committee provides $35,000,000 for Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Research Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes and expects the administration to fully fund Cooperative Institutes at appropriate levels in future years. This funding level reflects the Committee's adoption of the proposed transition of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Demonstration Testbed from OAR to the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, as part of the establishment of an unmanned systems operations program.
The Committee continues to strongly support the established institutes, including those focused on watershed effects on marine ecosystems, remote sensing, long-term monitoring of oil spill impacts on marine ecosystem health, coastal resilience, ocean exploration within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, and harmful algal blooms.
Cooperative Institutes for the 21st Century [CI21].--The Committee supports the vision of NOAA's "Prospectus for Cooperative Institutes in the 21st Century," and directs NOAA to fully implement the CI21 recommendations to the extent to which the agency has not already done so. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, NOAA is directed to submit a report to the Committee that details how each of the CI21 recommendations have been, or are being, implemented. Furthermore, OAR is directed to provide the Committee the results of the review of Cooperative Institute research themes and efforts called for within CI21.
National Sea Grant College Program.--The Committee roundly rejects the administration's proposed elimination of NOAA's Sea Grant program. Instead, the Committee provides an increase of $7,000,000 above the fiscal year 2019 level for the Sea Grant program and its research, education, extension, and outreach activities, which are critical for coastal communities and benefit the entire Nation. This level of funding supports the key focus areas in the program's strategic plan: sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, resilient communities and economies, healthy coastal ecosystems, environmental literacy, and workforce development. In addition, the Committee directs NOAA to continue funding all Sea Grant STEM education and fellowship programs. Further, NOAA is directed to continue its partnership with academic programs that provide legal expertise related to Sea Grant's mission and also encourages the Sea Grant program to prioritize providing training, education, outreach, and technical assistance for young fishermen.
Additionally, the Committee understands that the Sea Grant program provides no less than $1,000,000 in annual base funding, or $4,000,000 over the course of the 4-year grant cycle, to each Sea Grant program with Institutional or College Program status. NOAA is directed to continue this funding model.
Sea Grant Fellowship Program.--NOAA's Sea Grant program is reminded that the Committee's broad support is due to the program's historically objective standards, State-driven goals, and non-partisan priorities. Within NOAA's Sea Grant program, the National Sea Grant Fellowship program serves as a valuable pipeline for our Nation's future ocean science and policy experts. The Fellowship program should remain objective and apolitical, and should increase its efforts to recruit qualified, non-partisan candidates who are committed to working on oceans and coastal issues for any Member of Congress, regardless of political affiliation.
Fisheries-Related Research.--The Committee looks forward to receiving, and being briefed on, the results of the Sea Grant sponsored project to "Estimate the Absolute Abundance of Red Snapper in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico" in fiscal year 2020.
The Committee remains concerned about the negative impacts of short recreational fishing seasons for other reef-fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Additional data sources and assessment approaches are also needed for these species and these efforts should continue to be pursued by entities other than NOAA's regulating line office, NMFS. Therefore, the Committee provides $5,000,000 within Sea Grant above the fiscal year 2019 level to partner with academic research institutions to develop agency- independent estimates of the abundance of greater amberjack in the Gulf of Mexico. Sea Grant is encouraged to coordinate with NMFS during the formulation and execution of this opportunity.
American Lobster Research.--Within funding for the Sea Grant program, the Committee provides $2,000,000 for partnerships between State agencies, academia, and industry to address American lobster research priorities in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and southern New England. Research should focus on overcoming reduced availability of herring for lobster bait and stock resilience in the face of environmental changes, including life history parameters, distribution and abundance, and species interactions, with the purpose of informing future management actions.
Highly Migratory Species.--The Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted level within OAR for the Sea Grant program to partner with State agencies, academia, and the fishing industry to research highly migratory fish species in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. This should include examining the impact of offshore oil platforms on the biology of highly migratory species, such as yellow fin tuna. Highly migratory species, and the coastal communities that rely on the health of these stocks, could greatly benefit from improved, science-based management and conservation.
Aquaculture Research.--The Committee provides $13,000,000 for marine aquaculture research. NOAA is directed to support marine aquaculture research and development in partnership with universities, including with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Similar research efforts have led to beneficial outcomes such as the development and commercialization of new technologies to meet the domestic demand for seafood, including finfish, shrimp, and oysters. NOAA is encouraged to use the increase above fiscal year 2019 levels to explore new research topics, including engineering of ocean-based infrastructure, accumulation and metabolization rates of brevetoxins in commonly farmed shellfish, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.
Ocean Exploration.--The Committee directs OAR to maximize the amount of appropriated funding provided to the new Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute. NOAA is also encouraged to work with the Department of Defense and other relevant agencies to continue fundamental ocean exploration in which open source data are collected for the oceanographic community and private industries in real-time through telepresence technology.
National Oceanographic Partnership Program.--The Committee provides $5,000,000 to advance ocean science research through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program [NOPP] (10 U.S.C. 7901-7903), provided that none of the funding provided may be used to support more than 50 percent of any particular project cost.
The Committee supports the original intent of NOPP, and encourages NOAA to leverage this investment by partnering with other Federal agencies with a shared interest in ocean research, operations, technology, education, and natural resource management, to pursue research that advances multiple agency missions.
Environmental Genomics.--The Committee rejects the administration's proposal to terminate the environmental genomics program. Instead, the Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 enacted level for these activities. The Committee notes that NOAA's work in this area suggests that environmental genomics is a promising, reliable, and affordable ocean observation tool.
NOAA NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
The Committee's recommendation provides $1,060,045,000 for the National Weather Service [NWS]. NWS programs provide timely and accurate meteorologic, hydrologic, and oceanographic warnings and forecasts to ensure the safety of the population, mitigate property losses, and improve the economic productivity of the Nation. NWS is also responsible for issuing operational climate forecasts for the United States. The Committee has made saving lives and livelihoods through accurate weather forecasting a priority.
The Committee's recommendations are displayed in the following table:
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OPERATIONS, RESEARCH, AND FACILITIES
[In thousands of dollars]
View table at https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/127/1?s=2&r=1
Information Technology Officers [ITOs].--The Committee does not approve the NWS proposal to consolidate ITOs. The Committee notes that NWS was again invited to submit a proposal for a single pilot Regional Enterprise Application Development and Integration [READI] team comprised of volunteer ITOs. However, the Committee still has not yet received such a proposal. Should NWS decide to submit a proposal for a single pilot READI team project, its subsequent successes and challenges will assist the Committee in evaluating the larger consolidation proposal if resubmitted in future fiscal years.
NWS Staffing.--The Committee recognizes NWS's work to fill vacancies, especially for weather forecast personnel. However, there is a long way to go, and the Committee continues to be concerned with the number of NWS employee vacancies. Given the importance of the NWS mission to protect the lives and property of our Nation's citizens, extended vacancies are unacceptable-- particularly when the Committee has provided more than adequate resources and direction to fill vacancies expeditiously for the past several fiscal years. The Committee does not adopt the proposed NWS workforce savings and directs NWS to continue efforts to fill all vacancies as expeditiously as possible.
Furthermore, NOAA shall continue to provide quarterly briefings to the Committees on all NWS staffing issues, to include: a list of funded vacancies, by type and location, including the length of time the positions have been vacant; the Program, Project, or Activity [PPA] from which each vacancy is funded, and the plan for addressing each vacancy; an update on the implementation of the Operations and Workforce Analysis; budget execution by PPA; major procurements; and other topics as appropriate.
Observations.--The Committee rejects all proposed cuts to Upper Air, Surface, and Marine Observations.
Weather Radar Interference.--The Committee encourages the mitigation of interference and impacts from wind farms on Doppler weather radars, particularly in the interior portions of the United States where the most new wind power capacity is being added. The Committee supports the directive included in Section 318 of the Conference Report accompanying Public Law 115-232, for NOAA and the Department of Defense to conduct a joint study on the impact of wind farms on weather radars. NOAA is directed to provide the Committee with the results of this study upon completion and recommendations regarding the Federal Aviation Administration obstruction evaluation process under 49 U.S.C. 44718.
National Ice Center Technical Transfer.--The Committee adopts the proposed transfer of the National Ice Center from the National Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service [NESDIS] to NWS.
National Mesonet Program.--The Committee provides $20,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 over the fiscal year 2019 level, for the continuation and expansion of the National Mesonet Program. Investments going forward should sustain coverage of data types and areas now included within the national mesonet, as well as an expansion of in-situ and remote sensing capabilities to include weather measurements in high- risk areas. The Committee encourages the National Mesonet Program to proactively work with other Federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Geological Survey, to identify observations and platforms of opportunity in areas with sparse instrumentation that may be transferred to the National Mesonet Program.
NEXRAD Coverage Gaps.--The Committee remains concerned about gaps in national coverage by the NEXRAD system. The Committee encourages NWS to continue its close coordination with local governments and weather officials to ensure that radar gaps are lowered to the maximum extent practicable.
NWS Staffing in Alaska.--The Committee remains concerned about potential NWS staffing reductions in Alaska and reminds NWS that any staffing changes must comply with the reprogramming procedures set forth in section 505 of this act. Prior to proposing any staffing reductions, NWS shall conduct community outreach meetings in all affected communities.
National Centers for Environmental Prediction [NCEP].--The Committee does not adopt the NWS proposal to consolidate centers under NCEP in fiscal year 2020.
Facilities Maintenance.--Within funding for Analyze, Forecast, and Support, the Committee continues to encourage NWS to address its highest priority facilities repair and deferred maintenance requirements at Weather Forecast Offices.
Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services Expansion [AHPS].-- The Committee again rejects NWS's proposal to slow the expansion of AHPS, which will enable greater information on the magnitude and likelihood of floods and droughts across certain areas of the nation. No less than the fiscal year 2019 level is provided for AHPS activities.
National Data Buoy Center [NDBC].--The Committee provides sufficient funding to maintain, at a minimum, NDBC operations at 80 percent data availability. The Committee directs NOAA to provide adequate funding to support maintenance and service of the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean Array and Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis Array across the equatorial Pacific. The Committee further directs NOAA to include a schedule to restore existing data buoy operability and its strategy to minimize outages in the future as part of the agency's spending plan.
Tsunami Warning Program.--The Committee rejects NWS's proposed cut to the Tsunami Warning Program. Funding is provided at no less than the fiscal year 2019 amounts, including for the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation program grants, to ensure that high-quality tsunami watches, warnings, and advisories are issued to safeguard lives and property. The Committee expects NWS to expeditiously fill the current vacancies.
Further, the Committee directs NWS to submit a report explaining: (1) how tsunami warnings are issued and how the information is disseminated to all communities under a warning; (2) what NWS is doing to ensure that tsunami warnings reach all communities, including those with limited cellular service and broadband infrastructure; (3) how the alert and warning systems work and interact with other emergency notification alert systems; (4) how third-party disseminators are educated to interpret and use the alert and warning systems, including test messages; and (5) what NWS is doing to conduct outreach and trainings with local emergency managers in advance of a warning being issued.
Office of Water Prediction [OWP].--The Committee provides no less than $33,000,000 for OWP, which receives funding across multiple NWS budget lines. The Committee rejects the proposed decrease for OWP within Analyze, Forecast, and Support and provides increased funding above fiscal year 2019 levels to continue to expedite hiring within the National Water Center [NWC] Water Prediction Operations Division and reach full operating capability. The Committee notes that the unprecedented flooding season of 2019 further demonstrates the urgent need to achieve full operating capability at the NWC as soon as possible in order to adequately support its role as the NWS center of excellence for water resources prediction and related decision support services. Therefore, NOAA is directed to transition OWP personnel from other offices to the NWC, as deemed necessary to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Within 45 days of enactment of this act, NOAA is directed to provide the Committee with an updated staffing plan for the NWC that reflects the direction provided herein.
The Committee is pleased with the ongoing research-to- operations efforts within OWP and provides increased funding over fiscal year 2019 levels to continue to expedite development of the National Water Model and other next- generation water modeling capabilities. NWS shall leverage this funding with resources provided to NWS for hydrology and water resource programs, NOS for IWP, and OAR for hydrologic modeling grants. The Committee directs NWS to continue to expeditiously transition the water resources prediction capabilities developed by OWP into operations.
Dissemination Technical Transfer.--The Committee adopts the technical transfer of $25,000,000 from PAC to ORF for Dissemination.
Hydrology and Water Resource Programs.--The Committee provides no less than $6,000,000 for NWS, in coordination with existing academic research consortiums, to collaborate with external academic partners to improve fine and large-scale measurements of snow depth and soil moisture data that can be used to expand and improve the National Water Model and contribute directly to the mission of NOAA's National Water Center.
Consumer Option for an Alternative System To Allocate Losses [COASTAL] Act Implementation.--Within funding provided for Science and Technology Integration, the Committee provides not less than $5,000,000 for the continued development and implementation of the COASTAL Act, which was included in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (Public Law 112-141). The Committee supports NOAA's work to assist homeowners impacted by destructive winds and storm surges associated with hurricanes and super-storms. The Committee directs NOAA to continue to leverage existing Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships in carrying out COASTAL Act activities.
Storm Surge Modeling Technology.--The Committee recognizes the need to deploy more precise, accurate, and real-time modeling technology that is tailored to specific regions. These activities would improve and complement NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes [SLOSH] model. The Committee directs NOAA to expand existing collaborations with research universities that will produce better predictive capabilities than NOAA's current SLOSH model provides. The Committee directs NOAA, in collaboration with academic research institutions and other Federal agencies, to integrate improved technologies into standard modeling operations for storm surge and inland flooding.
Science and Technology Integration.--The Committee provides no less than the fiscal year 2019 level for Mid-Range Weather Outlooks, including seasonal to subseasonal forecasting, and Investments in Numerical Weather Prediction Modeling, which provides critical support to the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project, among other important forecasting activities. Furthermore, the Committee urges NOAA to expedite the project plan described by the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Act (Public Law 115-25). The Committee encourages NWS to reduce errors in tracking and intensity forecasts of hurricanes by identifying technology and methods available to significantly improve hurricane forecasting.
NOAA NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICE
The Committee's recommendation provides $259,739,000 for National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service [NESDIS] operations. NESDIS programs operate environmental polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites and collect and archive global environmental data and information for distribution to users in commerce, industry, agriculture, science, and engineering, the general public, and Federal, State, and local agencies.
The Committee's recommendations are displayed in the following table:

Full text: A Hawaii company wants to open the first offshore fish farm in the Gulf of Mexico about 45 miles west of Sarasota. The Environmental Protection Agency, which approved a draft permit for the project in August, is seeking public comment on issuing a final permit through Sunday.

Fishing and environmental groups have raised objections to the proposal by Kampachi Farms to anchor a chain-link mesh pen offshore to raise 20,000 Almaco jack fish  a relative of the popular amberjack  for human consumption. The company plans to hatch the fish from eggs in tanks onshore, then when they become fingerlings, move them to the open-ocean pen.

The farm, a pilot project, would be not only a first for the gulf, it would be the first in the federal waters of the continental United States. If it works, look for others to follow, here and elsewhere, said Kampachi co-founder Neil Anthony Sims.

We think the gulf coast of Florida around Tampa offers the most advantageous loca

tion, given the criteria were looking at, Sims said. Other companies are eyeing potential fish farm locations off California and New Yorks Long Island, he said.

Thats the main reason the Kampachi proposal is drawing opposition from environmental groups and commercial fishing operations: They dont want offshore fish farms to start popping up around the country because they view the farms as a threat to clean water and a thriving fishing industry.

That the EPAs analysis says those farms wouldnt have a detrimental environmental impact is folly, just folly, said Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner for Friends of the Earth.

She cited potential problems with untreated fish feces, pollution from antibiotics and other medical waste, and the risk of sick fish escaping from the mesh cage and spreading illnesses among wild fish stocks. She also said the mesh might entangle migratory birds and marine mammals in the gulf, including the Brydes whale, recently classified as endangered.

Though other countries do allow offshore aquaculture projects like Kampachis, Denmark officials said just last month that they would not allow the opening or expansion of any more offshore fish farms beyond the 19 they have permitted. They cited environmental problems from the existing farms as the reason.

We have major challenges with oxygen deficiencies, environmental minister Lea Wermelin said, and we can see that nitrogen emissions are not falling as expected.

But Sims said his company, founded in 2010, has successfully opened similar farms off Mexico and Hawaii, and used that experience in selecting a prime spot in the gulf thats in 130 feet of water. That allows the owners to lower the cage deep for protection when a Category 4 or 5 hurricane passes by.

Sims said concerns about pollution from what he called fish poo are overblown. After all, he said, a lot more of it used to be in the worlds oceans until anglers caught so many fish. Its a natural part of the ecosystem, he said.

And the EPA draft says that any potentially harmful discharge  should disperse rapidly.

The concentration of thousands of fish swimming in one spot, though, is what raises the concern about fish waste among environmental groups. Gulf currents wouldnt necessarily just whisk it away, either, said Robert Weisberg, a University of South Florida College of Marine Sciences physical oceanographer.

Sometimes currents would carry things out of there, and sometimes they wouldnt, because its variable, Weisberg said. You cant simply say its always hunky-dory.

Sims seemed less prepared for questions about how the company would deal with a Red Tide algae bloom in the gulf. One such bloom that began 40 miles out in the gulf in November 2017 plagued the state for more than a year, killing thousands of fish, as well as manatees and sea turtles.

As with a hurricane, he said, the company would try to ride out any toxic algae bloom by cranking the cage down beneath the waves. However, he said, we dont have any absolute certainty that that tactic would work. Thats the point of starting with a pilot project, to see how it goes, he said.

Sims said his company is negotiating with Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota and the University of Miamis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science to handle the onshore part of the project producing the fingerlings. He said his company has no estimate of the total cost of the pilot program but its an expensive demonstration.

Should the EPA greenlight the project, that would not be the last permit required to get started, Sims said. The company would also have to get permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because of the need to anchor in navigable federal waters.

He said that far from hurting Floridas other industries, the fish pen would attract lots of other wild fish and would turn into a popular spot for snorkelers and divers. Its like (the TV nature series) Blue Planet in real life, he said.

Full text: Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, issued the following news release:
Today, Governor Ron DeSantis announced the appointments of 11 expert researchers and leading scientists to the recently re-organized Red Tide Task Force. The Governor was joined by Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Secretary Noah Valenstein and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) Executive Director Eric Sutton. For over 15 years, this Task Force had been inactive and without funding until it's re-organization by FWC today at the direction of Governor DeSantis. Governor DeSantis originally called for the re-organization of the task force on his second day in office via Executive Order 19-12.
"The Red Tide Task Force will focus on the causes of Red Tide and will be supported by FWC's Center for Red Tide Research, which received $4.8 million in the budget," said Governor DeSantis. "My administration will continue to press forward to find solutions and empower our brightest minds to help protect our environment. The issues of Red Tide are complex, but with the appointments of these leading scientists and researchers, we hope to make a difference."
"Governor DeSantis has made it clear that the water quality in this state is a top priority," said DEP Secretary Noah Valenstein. "Bringing some of the state's top environmental scientists together to address Red Tide will complement the efforts of the experts on the Blue-Green Algae Task Force and enable us to expedite our efforts to restore and protect our fresh and marine waters."
"Thank you to Governor DeSantis for his commitment to water quality and our environment. We are excited about the announcement today of these task force members," said FWC Director Eric Sutton. "We look forward to working with the task force and partners as we continue to protect the state's resources."
The Red Tide Task Force will complement the Blue Green Algae Task Force and the Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative, which is the partnership between the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute within FWC and Mote Marine Laboratory.
Red Tide blooms have been documented along Florida's Gulf coast since the 1840s, and recently Florida had experienced one of its most severe red tide blooms on record. Over the course of 16 months, from November of 2017 until February of 2019, this Red Tide event was recorded as the fifth longest since 1953, and the first since 2007 to impact Florida's southwest, northwest, and east coasts simultaneously.

- UM Rosenstiel School researchers monitor nutrient footprint from offshore aquaculture
* * *
By Diana Udel
A new study led by scientists at the University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science found minimal environmental impacts to the surrounding waters from a major commercial fish-farming operation off the coast of Panama.
Researchers collected water samples at one upstream and three downstream locations from the submerged fish cages to investigate if there was significant or cumulative impacts resulting from locating fish farms offshore. Sediment samples were also collected to evaluate the effects of the aquaculture facility on the seafloor.
The data revealed that only small amounts of nutrients are released from the farm and demonstrated that when appropriately sited, commercially scaled offshore aquaculture installations have the potential to operate in a way that produces a relatively small pollution footprint. The results also showed that any impacts from offshore fish farming are minimal compared to all other forms of animal protein production for human consumption.
"We must produce 30 million metric tons of seafood to keep up with human population growth and increasing consumption of seafood - and the open ocean appears to be the best if not the only environment that would allow for this expansion," said the study's lead author Aaron Welch, Ph.D. who conducted the study while a graduate student at the UM Rosenstiel School and UM Abess Center. "Showing that this can be done without incurring in a large footprint is something we will all benefit from. It's a very relevant milestone to assist in developing offshore aquaculture in the Unites States."
The fish farm off the coast of Panama analyzed in this study houses 22 prism-shaped cages 13 kilometers offshore in waters from 55 to 65 meters deep, producing more than 1,400 metric tons of fish per year.
"This study is of great interest to all stakeholders concerned with the expansion of offshore aquaculture in the United States and other countries," said the study's co-author Daniel Benetti, a professor in the Department or Marine Ecosystems and Society and director of aquaculture at the UM Rosenstiel School. "To our knowledge, this is the first report of its kind from a commercially scaled aquaculture facility utilizing offshore submersible cage technologies."
The study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of organic and inorganic pollution from offshore fish farming, one of the major concerns raised in relation to commercial aquaculture production.
"This research shows that seafood production for human consumption can be produced in the offshore environment with relatively low environmental impact compared to other production methods," said Benetti.
The study, titled "The nutrient footprint of a submerged-cage offshore aquaculture facility located in the tropical Caribbean," was recently published in the Journal of the World Aquaculture Society. The study's authors include: Aaron W. Welch, Sharein El Tourky, Zachary Daugherty, Gary Hitchcock and Daniel Benetti of the UM Rosenstiel School and Angela N. Knapp of Florida State University.
The study received support from the NOAA Marine Fisheries Initiative (grant number NA12NMF4330087) and the NOAA Sea Grant Aquaculture Research Program (project number NA10OAR4170079).

* * *
- Summit Introduces New Economic and Ecologic Possibilities
* * *
Legislators, scholars, restaurant owners, and state officials gathered at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi for "Texas Oyster Aquaculture Summit - A New Industry for Texas" held July 10. The full-day summit, hosted by State Representative Todd Hunter, focused on Texas oyster aquaculture and House Bill 1300, a new law co-authored by Hunter that allows oyster mariculture in Texas, which is predicted to generate a significant economic boost to the Coastal Bend and reduce harvest pressure on wild oyster reefs.
Morning summit sessions included discussions on topics such as the history and status of U.S. oyster aquaculture, legislation and regulatory environment, and perspective on oyster culture. The keynote luncheon was presented by Dennis Bonnen, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.
"House Bill 1300 is unleashing a new era of growth for the state," said Bonnen. "While you know the House and the Senate got this bill through to the governor's desk... it was due to all the stakeholders in this room ... because of your education and advocacy... no longer is the coast without an oyster aquaculture program."
After lunch, attendees gained more insight into this industry through panels on conservation, reef restoration, marketing, and event got to taste-test oysters.
The Island University's Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies has a long history of involvement with oysters and their importance to our coastal waters, from the Sink Your Shucks program to the Oyster Resource and Recovery Center and extensive research on the mollusks. Many of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi's own sat on summit panels, including Dr. Larry McKinney, Senior Executive Director of the HRI, who discussed how aquaculture could strengthen the sustainability of the Coastal Bend's ecology.
"This industry meets the Institute's vision of an economically and environmentally sustainable Gulf Coast," said McKinney. "Oyster mariculture will reduce the impacts of oyster dredging which destroys oyster reefs, so having this new industry that's less destructive means we have more jobs and less negative impact on the bay."
Destructive fishing practices and a string of natural disasters have led to a steep decline in Texas oyster production since 2010. According to researchers at the HRI, oysters are vital to the health of the coast because they are responsible for increasing water quality, greater water circulation, and stabilizing the sea floor. Also, where oysters are, other sea life follows, and where sea life thrives, anglers gather - ultimately leading to greater tourism and bringing a new era of environmental and ecologic growth.
"I'm humbly grateful to be part of a team that is going to write the next chapter in the seafood industry of the Texas coast," said Brad Lomax, President of Waterstreet Seafood Co., who spoke at the summit. "What we do here today and over the next 12 months is going to set the tone and trajectory and define the impact that this segment of the business is going to have on the state of Texas. We are all a part of writing history."
Oyster farming, which can be done either by building a bed or suspending net bags above the ground, provides a new local source for oysters that are increasingly in demand - as many Texas restaurants must import farm-grown half-shell oysters from other states - and will bring more jobs to the Coastal Bend. However, HB 1300 still requires the Texas Parks & Wildlife Commission to adopt rules establishing a program governing the process of growing cultivated oysters.
"This oyster summit is launching something I haven't seen in my 50-year career," said McKinney. "We're talking in terms of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of economic impact through the beginning of an entirely new industry on the coast."
Texans can expect to begin pulling oysters from the water and putting them onto plates by spring 2021.

A Florida company is still working to secure financing for the construction of a $30 million eel farm on land in the city's industrial park.
If Aqua Vida Aquaculture's plans for the facility come to fruition, it could entice more fish-farming operations to the region and state, said Keith Lambert, vice president of business attraction at Lansing Economic Development Partnership.
Michigan is potentially a "world-class place" to grow the aquaculture industry using recirculating system technology, according to Aqua Vida's Founder and Managing Partner Kit Munday.
Recirculating systems allow for more complete control of the environment in which fish are raised. LEAP officials believe fish farms that operate on land in controlled environments offer better control of environmental and pollution conditions than traditional pond or net-pen farming methods.
"We found that very compelling," Lambert said. "I think the potential for Michigan is massive, and that's why we really prioritized this and have done a lot of leg work to work with this company."
But within the industry itself there are varying opinions about how big a role those systems will play in future aquaculture operations within the U.S.
Not the first to look at our region Aqua Vida Aquaculture first reached out to LEAP officials in 2015. They helped the company look for viable locations for the business, identifying the 2 acres in St. Johns.
The farm would utilize a "recirculating aquaculture system" to produce farm-raised, African longfin eel and American eel for customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, Munday said.
Water at the facility would be recirculated and reused, and the eels raised there would have no contact with lakes or rivers.
Aqua Vida isn't the first company to approach the organization about bringing more aquaculture to the region using a recirculating system, Lambert said.
At least three different companies have approached LEAP with similar proposals, he said, and at least one other is looking at sites in the region and in other states for a potential salmon operation.
Aqua Vida has gone further though, working with state officials as they conducted a "risk analysis" of the proposal and established requirements for establishing and operating the business safely, Lambert said.
"I think this would be the first large-scale commercial operation of this type in the state," he said.
Attracting aquaculture businesses to the region is important, Lambert said, because global demand for seafood is expected to increase.
"There's a lot of investment up front but we believe strongly that this is where the future of seafood production is headed," he said.
Opinions vary on technology Recirculating aquaculture systems are already a part of the fish-farming industry in Michigan and elsewhere.
At Harietta Hills Trout Farm in Wexford County, the technology is used to recirculate water in the farm's hatchery, said co-owner Dan Vogler, but the farm doesn't rely on it. Traditional aquaculture farming techniques still make up the bulk of the operation, he said.
Recirculating aquaculture systems have a place in the state's aquaculture business, said Vogler, who also serves as president of the Michigan Aquaculture Association.
Still, Vogler believes the up-front costs associated with establishing a facility dependent on recirculating technology is cost prohibitive for most fish farm operations. The energy costs associated with them are high too, he said.
"Are we going to build a whole industry on it? No," Vogler said. "I cannot take trout production indoors and make a living. At the end of the day, the system has to produce a product at a price that is going to get a consumer to purchase it."
Paul Zajicek, executive director of the National Aquaculture Association said the up-front costs for farms that run solely on recirculating aquaculture systems are high, but the technology is being used successfully in Japan and European aquaculture and, to a lesser degree, in the U.S.
"It is an expensive way to grow fish," Zajicek said. "Everyone will agree with that, but there are successful operations."
Blue Ridge Aquaculture, Inc. in Virginia has been growing tilapia indoors using a recirculating aquaculture system since 1993.
Last year, the company produced 4.4 million pounds of fish, said Jim Franklin, the company's chief financial officer. The farm's mortality rate is less than 2 percent, largely because Blue Ridge Aquaculture uses a recirculating system to control its water temperature and oxygenation, Franklin said.
He said how companies implement recirculating aquaculture systems can make or break them.
"These systems have been successful, but they depend on the design of the system itself," he said. "The fish depend on you 24 hours a day, and you have to be able to handle that."
Next steps There is no timeline in place for Aqua Vida Aquaculture's proposed facility.
"These things take time," Munday said, but the world needs high-quality protein and Michigan should be the place where it's produced.
"It's an amazing opportunity for the State of Michigan," he said.
Lambert agreed. If the company is successful it will help attract more businesses that use the same approach, he said.
"We need to figure out ways to encourage this type of seafood raising in a lot of different species," Lambert said. "They might start with eels, but what Aqua Vida's doing can be applied to a lot of different species too."

Court Stops Industrial Fish Farms in Gulf of Mexico

Full text: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Yesterday, an unusual coalition of fishing and public interest groups, represented by the Center for Food Safety, won a lawsuit challenging the Department of Commerce's rules that would have permitted, for the first time, industrial finfish farms offshore in U.S. waters.
"This is a landmark victory for protecting our oceans, for fishing communities and conservationists," said George Kimbrell, CFS Legal Director and lead counsel in the case. "Allowing industrial net-pen aquaculture and its known environmental harms in the Gulf of Mexico was a grave threat. Very simply, as the Court properly held, aquaculture is not 'fishing.' Such harm cannot be allowed under existing fisheries law never intended for that purpose."
The rules challenged in the lawsuit focused on the Gulf of Mexico, but also could have paved the way for fish farm permits all around the U.S. The Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled that existing fisheries management laws were never intended to regulate aquaculture (the farming of fish in pens or cages), concluding that the Department of Commerce "acted outside of its statutory authority…"
Marianne Cufone, local counsel and Executive Director of the Recirculating Farms Coalition  (RFC) said, "This ruling makes clear that existing fisheries law cannot be manipulated to develop and expand marine finfish farming in the Gulf or other U.S. waters. Now we can focus on stopping Congress from passing new laws to promote this outdated and unnecessary industry."
Since the 1980's, Congress has periodically attempted to pass laws promoting marine finfish farms, but all failed due to massive public opposition. Federal agencies then tried to permit fish farms under existing fisheries management laws. The lawsuit stopped that, so Congress is back on it. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi recently introduced the Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture (AQUAA) Act and a similar bill is expected in the House of Representatives soon. RFC and others plan to again turn their attention to Capitol Hill.
Globally, industrial aquaculture has been associated with many serious environmental and health concerns: farmed fish escapes into the wild; competition between wild and farmed fish for habitat, food and mates, or their intermixing causing changes in genetics and behaviors; spread of diseases or parasites from farmed fish to wild fish and other marine life; and pollution from excess feed, wastes and chemicals flowing through the open pens into natural waters.
"We applaud today's ruling! We must protect our ocean resources from the many threats posed by offshore aquaculture," said Cynthia Sarthou, Executive Director of the Gulf Restoration Network, another plaintiff in the case.
Industrial aquaculture can also come with significant socioeconomic costs - creating market competition that drives down the price of wild fish and devaluing of quota shares, resulting in the loss of fishing and fishing-related employment and income. Less money for fishing men and women means less money spent in coastal communities too, hurting other businesses.
"All of us who depend on the Gulf are profoundly grateful that the Court has struck down these dangerous regulations that would have polluted our waters and damaged our way of life,"  said Gulf Fishermen's Association attorney William Ward. "Today is a great day."
Wenonah Hauter, Executive Director of plaintiff organization Food & Water Watch, said, "Today's decision reaffirms that Congress never intended for the federal government to allow massive factory fish farms in federal waters. The Court recognized that this irresponsible plan was an overreach by the federal government that would give away our public resources to another polluting industry."
The plaintiff groups on the lawsuit make up a broad array of interests, including commercial, economic, recreational, farming and conservation purposes: Gulf Fishermen's Association; Gulf Restoration Network; Charter Fishermen's Association; Destin Charter Boat Association; Alabama Charter Fishing Association; Fish for America, USA, Inc.; Florida Wildlife Federation; Recirculating Farms Coalition; and Food & Water Watch.

Victory! Court Shuts Down Offshore Aquaculture in Gulf of Mexico

Full text: The Center for Food Safety issued the following news release:
Today, Center for Food Safety, representing a coalition of fishing and public interest groups, won their lawsuit challenging the Department of Commerce's new federal rules that would have permitted, for the first time, industrial aquaculture offshore in U.S. federal waters.
"This is a landmark victory for protecting our oceans, for fishing communities and conservationists," said George Kimbrell, CFS Legal Director and lead counsel in the case. "Allowing industrial net-pen aquaculture and its known environmental harms in the Gulf of Mexico is a grave threat. Very simply, as the Court properly held, aquaculture is not 'fishing.' These types of harms cannot be allowed under existing fisheries law never intended for that purpose."
The case involved permitting rules for the Gulf of Mexico, but was the test case for similar rules planned off all other U.S. coasts. The Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled that existing fisheries management laws were never intended to regulate aquaculture (the farming of fish in net-pens), which presents different types of harms than traditional fishing, and thus Commerce did not have the authority to permit aquaculture as part of its regulation of fishing and wild fisheries. The Court resoundingly rejected the government's attempt to permit the novel aquaculture scheme based on its authority over "fishing," concluding that the Department of Commerce "acted outside of its statutory authority in shoehorning an entire regulatory scheme into a single unambiguous word." The decision means that industrial aquaculture, with its potential harm to commercial and recreational fisheries, the environment and imperiled species, will not be permitted in the U.S. federal waters of the Gulf under existing law.
"All of us that depend on the Gulf for our communities and livelihood are profoundly grateful that the Court has struck down this dangerous scheme, that would have polluted our waters and damaged our way of life," said Gulf fisherman and Gulf Fishermen's Association counsel William Ward. "Today is a great day."
Plaintiff Gulf Restoration Network commented: "We applaud today's ruling! We must protect our ocean resources from the many threats posed by offshore aquaculture," said Cynthia Sarthou, Executive Director.
The federal permitting scheme, struck down by the Court today, would have allowed up to 20 industrial facilities and collectively 64 million pounds of fish to be grown each year in the Gulf. Industrial aquaculture in open waters, such as the ones proposed, are associated with many serious environmental and health concerns, including: the escape of farmed fish into the wild; outcompeting wild fish for habitat; food and mates or intermixing with wild fish and altering their genetics and behaviors; the spread of diseases and parasites from farmed fish to wild fish and other marine life; and pollution from excess feed, wastes and any antibiotics or other chemicals used flowing through the open pens into natural waters.
Marianne Cufone, Executive Director of Plaintiff Recirculating Farms Coalition and local counsel in the case: "This ruling makes clear that existing fisheries law cannot be manipulated to develop and expand marine finfish farming in the Gulf or other U.S. waters. Now we can focus on stopping Congress from passing new laws to promote this outdated and unnecessary industry."
In addition to ecological and public health risks, industrial aquaculture can also come with significant socioeconomic costs. Large aquaculture structures often attract wild fish away from their usual habitats, but the "buffer" zones adopted by the Department of Commerce would have prevented fishing near the farm facilities, preventing fishermen and women from accessing the displaced fish. Offshore aquaculture also creates market competition that drives down the price of wild fish, and results in the loss of fishing and fishing-related employment and income. Less money for fishermen and women means less money spent in coastal communities too, hurting other businesses.
"Today's decision reaffirms that Congress never intended for the federal government to allow massive factory fish farms in federal waters," said Wenonah Hauter, Executive Director of Food & Water Watch, another of the plaintiff organizations. "The Court recognized that this irresponsible plan was an overreach by the federal government that would give away our public resources to another polluting industry."
The plaintiff coalition CFS is representing in the case make up a broad array of significant interests in the Gulf of Mexico, including commercial, economic, recreational, and conservation purposes: the Gulf Fishermen's Association; Gulf Restoration Network; Charter Fishermen's Association; Destin Charter Boat Association; Alabama Charter Fishing Association; Fish for America, USA, Inc.; Florida Wildlife Federation; Recirculating Farms Coalition; and Food & Water Watch.
Contrary to claims that farmed fish production will alleviate pressure on wild fish stocks, industrial aquaculture has actually exacerbated the population declines of wild fish. This will be especially true in offshore aquaculture facilities that farm carnivorous fish, which require a diet often derived from wild-caught fish such as menhaden, mackerel, herring, and anchovies. The industry's ever-growing demand for fish in feed jeopardizes the survival of wild fish and disrupts the balance of the marine ecosystem.

Groups March in Washington, DC During Oceans Week To Oppose Offshore Fish Farms

Full text: WASHINGTON, June 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, hundreds of people join together in a March for the Oceans in Washington, DC. Preventing development of industrial ocean fish farms is a prominent issue for participants, wearing pins and carrying signs with the hashtag "#dontcageouroceans".

Alfredo Quarto of the Mangrove Action Project said, "MAP has advocated for over two decades against open water industrial fish feedlots globally. We strongly urge Congress not to consider these kinds of wasteful and unsustainable systems in the U.S."

Worldwide, ocean finfish aquaculture has caused a wide range of problems, including fish escapes; deaths of sharks, seals and other marine life; and changes in ocean ecosystems.

Marianne Cufone, Executive Director for the Recirculating Farms Coalition said, "Industrial open water finfish farming is an outdated and unnecessary practice. It poses serious risks to our oceans and public health." Over 100 other organizations agree, and signed a letter earlier in the week to members of Congress, calling on legislators to protect oceans from development of marine finfish aquaculture off U.S. shores.

Over the past 15 years, Congress proposed draft laws that would permit industrial finfish farming around the U.S. However, overwhelming public opposition stopped enactment of such sweeping federal laws. Now, Capitol Hill legislators are developing a new initiative for industrial aquaculture in U.S. waters. Opponents are collectively rising to protect fishing communities, public health and our oceans.

"Industrial aquaculture is not a solution to any perceived concerns about seafood; it will only lead to future problems. Every fishing community we visited so far on the America the Bountiful Tour raised concerns about impacts of industrial aquaculture on the marine ecosystem and coastal economies," said Niaz Dorry, the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance's coordinating director, who is traveling to rural fishing communities around the country. "A growing world population should not be used to justify industrial aquaculture. Our focus needs to be on changing our food system to one that supports what is available in our marine ecosystem."

Diverse organizations are rapidly joining the campaign to stop industrial finfish farming. Many are planning activities to reach out to others and get them involved in protecting our oceans.

"The Gulf of Mexico is a primary target for industrial aquaculture. Our participation in the march today is one of the first of many events to help raise awareness and prevent this industry from taking over our waters," said Raleigh Hoke, Campaign Director for the Gulf Restoration Network.

Full text: WEST BATH -- Jordan Kramer stood on the deck of his boat, the Muffin II, looking down at a pile of hundreds and hundreds of cream- and buff-colored quahogs spread out on a piece of plywood in an area roughly the size of a dinner platter. "A lot of work has gone into this small pile of clams," Kramer said.
Even though the clams are too tiny to even think about eating, that small pile was a success story. He'd planted 80,000 Mercenaria mercenaria (the proper name for what are more commonly called quahogs or hard-shell clams) seeds in June 2017, and lost half early on. Handling seed of 1 mm or smaller without losing some is not easy. But of those that remained, between 90 and 98 percent of his baby quahogs had survived their first winter on the New Meadows fish farm. Since June, the seed clams had shot up to 11 mm, and even 17 mm in size. They would have stopped growing around November, when Kramer put the farm to bed, but in the warming days of spring, they're already getting bigger.
Kramer went into aquaculture for the oysters, starting Winnegance Oyster Farm in 2014, and now has regular customers that range from wholesalers Harbor Fish and Upstream Trucking to restaurants like Woodford Food + Beverage and Island Creek's The Shop, both in Portland. Last year, he began to diversify with Mercenaria mercenaria, using seed he purchased from Muscongus Bay Aquaculture, which has a hatchery in Bremen. He's hoping to bring the quahogs to market in September, if all goes well this growing season. At that stage, they'd be called littlenecks (bigger quahogs are usually called cherrystones).
Farming littlenecks, Kramer is at the very edge of what could be the next trend in Maine aquaculture. Quahogs have a northern range that typically extended to Massachusetts. For years they have had a relatively small presence in Maine waters, in pockets, particularly around the Brunswick area, but in the era of climate change and rising ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, quahogs in the wild seem to be increasing.
"We are seeing sort of an expansion of their range northward," said Jon Lewis, who oversees aquaculture leases for Maine's Department of Marine Resources.
Kramer is trained as a wildlife biologist, and part of his reasoning for growing Mercenaria mercenaria is taking advantage of those warming waters for crop diversification. He already operates two 400-square-foot aquaculture leases and is permitted for two more this year. It's going well with oysters, but a second crop is a good way to hedge one's bets.
"This is my insurance policy," Kramer said of the quahogs. He had considered kelp, but the littlenecks made more financial sense. They have the potential to fetch a good price, particularly in the size range of about 11/2 inches, ideal for raw bars. "Littlenecks are unique in that they are more valuable at a smaller size," Kramer said.
Adult-sized Mercenaria mercenaria are far less subject to the predation from green crabs and milk ribbon worms that is ravaging populations of soft-shell or steamer clams. But as seed, or even the size of the baby clams on the deck of the Muffin II on a May day, they are vulnerable. Kramer figured he could give the species a boost by growing it within the netted protection of his oyster farm.
"It's a smart thing to do," Lewis said. "We have seen some soft-shell clams disappear and hard-shell seem to be doing better in Casco Bay."
History of hard shells
Kramer is not the first aquaculturist to try growing littlenecks in Maine, but at this point, he's seems to be the only one doing it. In other regions like Florida and Virginia, farm-raised littleneck clams are commonplace. But Maine has barely any experience in hard-shell clam aquaculture in part of because wild quahogs have such a limited and uneven history in the state.
Joe Porada started digging for quahogs in the late 1980s in the Goose Cove area of Trenton. He said he found a note on an early survey of Goose Cove showing that quahogs were there in the 19th century. His was an unusual pocket of productivity. There was another in the upper reaches of the New Meadows River, particularly in the New Meadows Lakes north of Route 1. Lewis said that area has been reliably rich in Mercenaria mercenaria for at least 15 years (although the fishery was shut down during the 2018 late winter months as numbers declined).
There was no way to account for the pocket of productivity in Goose Cove, but Porada didn't take it for granted. He had heard the tale of a Johnny Appleseed-like character who had tried to seed Maine mudflats for quahogs in the 1950s. Dana Wallace, a biologist who worked for the Department of Marine Resources for decades, had been trying to combat the 1950s green crab invasion with quahogs. Wallace, some believe, is the reason for the prevalence of quahogs in the Brunswick and West Bath area now.
But Wallace's best efforts down the coast hadn't worked. "He seeded in Sorrento and Sullivan, but they didn't take," Porada said. "Basically quahogs only grow west of Mount Desert Island and to the south." They are finicky. Porada worried about the future; at the rate he was going, he could fish out all the clams in Goose Cove. In 2005, Porada decided to try to farm quahogs. He called Brian Beal, a professor at the University of Maine at Machias and recalls Beal saying to him, "I have been waiting for this phone call for 25 years." Porada worked with the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education and secured funding via a 2006 grant from the Maine Technology Institute, with Beal providing the baby clams and research support. Together, they published a paper in the Journal of Shellfish Research in 2009 outlining their positive findings. "Hard clam farming in eastern Maine may help diversify a wild shellfish industry that is currently in decline for most species except lobsters," the paper said. It also called for additional efforts to explore alternative methods and sites.
But Porada is no longer growing quahogs. He's still wild-harvesting, but has moved into oyster aquaculture. With his quahogs he had been using the nets-on-flats method, laying down big nets on the flats filled with seeds, and there was too much labor involving both fighting off the green crabs and, in the winter, the scouring ice, which disrupts things like gear. "It meant they needed a lot more tending," Porada said. "I had to really be on the stuff when it started freezing." He and Beal also found that some mud just wasn't appealing to the quahogs. They tried to farm them in Egypt Bay, near Franklin, but the clams wouldn't burrow into the mud. Again, they're finicky. Farming oysters started to seem like a better alternative. He gave them a try in 2011 and redoubled his efforts around 2013. He's planning on making another attempt with oysters this year.
"They are contained, you can take them out of the water," Porada said. "You aren't just throwing them on the mud." Wild things
As Kramer navigated the Muffin II through the New Meadows, near Williams Island, he pointed out some of the productive mudflat areas nearby. In setting up his littleneck farm, he was very consciously trying to stay off of the flats. "It is about finding new ways to farm without getting in the way of people who are doing wild culture," Kramer said. "It's about creating new habitat." The mud in this area is soft and soupy - filled with nutrients for the clam. His thinking is he can get the benefits of that without intruding on the traditional clammers; his cages hang down into the sediment below his oyster cages and his farm is always underwater rather than on the flats.
That's likely a good idea. Chris Green, a clammer who is trying out aquaculture, started a soft- and hard-shell clam farm in Brunswick's Maquoit Bay in 2015. He cultivated seed in an upweller and transplanted them into the flats. There had been some die-off but the quahogs that survived were growing well, he said. Green was expecting they'd be big enough to market in three years. But when Green came to check his farm that December, he got a rude surprise. His buoys were "cut and slashed." He'd had some nets for the soft-shell clams. They were gone.
"That place got ravaged by pirates," he said. Meaning someone had taken his crop, presumably a competitor.
"To get the wild harvesters to leave you alone or just get on board is a fight within itself," Green said. Change will come eventually, he thinks, but it takes time for aquaculture to be seen as complementary, rather than as a threat. He's working with Manomet, the nonprofit that works on environmental solutions and climate change issues, in Brunswick on plans for a small farm near Princes Point that will be primarily for research. And he'll put quahogs there - as well as surveillance equipment. Pulling carbon
From the Muffin II, Kramer waved to a clammer in a fast air boat, racing down the New Meadows, and got a wave back. This is his new home of a sort, and he's eager to promote all the fisheries, including the other aquaculture happening nearby. He and friends at other New Meadows oyster farms - including Long Reach Oysters, Eider Cove and Nice Oyster Company - are cooking up plans for a summer boating event called Maine Oyster Sunday to promote local oysters. Kramer grew up in Portland, went to Vassar for college and worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before deciding to come back to Maine for good. He's done salt marsh research at the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, worked at Baxter State Park as a naturalist, done bird research for Maine Audubon and participated in a sediments project in Merrymeeting Bay for Bowdoin College. He's worked in fish markets and in greenhouses. But he's always had it in mind that he'd like to work for himself.
He also wanted to do something to counter the detrimental impacts of climate change he was constantly witnessing - and measuring - in his professional life.
"I felt like I wanted to do something that was really proactive," Kramer said. "Farming oysters is not just making a living, I am pulling tons of carbon." Meaning he's sequestering carbon, a major contributor to climate change, via the oysters. It helps him feel as though he is doing his own share of remediation.
In 2016, Kramer received a grant through the United States Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE), which he used to study success rates with different kinds of oyster cages. In 2017, he got a second SARE grant of almost $15,000 to test increasing his sea farm yields by adding littleneck clams to the farm. He has broad interests in aquaculture - he's still trying to figure out if he can maybe grow sea urchins - but littlenecks seemed worth trying.
Lewis said a handful of other aquaculturists have listed Mercenaria mercenaria on their lease agreements with the state as possible future crops, but he can't be sure which are actively working with quahogs and which are making a laundry list of possibilities. "We have got people with hard clams on there that I suspect are doing absolutely nothing with them," Lewis said. He said a few applications are pending. "The potential is entirely there for it to be a success," Lewis said. On the Muffin II, Kramer picked through the pile of baby littlenecks, picking out other species that had settled into the cages, including a couple of razor clams and a soft-shell clam. Then he began sweeping the clams onto a plastic dustpan to move them back into their caged growing area.
"This is a very scientific tool," he joked, right up there with the "indispensable" stainless steel barbecue cleaning tool many oyster farmers use to keep their cages clean. He enjoys many aspects of his farm, from the views to the wildlife he spots: gyres of herrings, nesting bald eagles, regular visits from curious seals. But the evolving education he's getting is clearly part of the job satisfaction.
"As a farmer you are constantly experimenting and adapting," he said. "It keeps things interesting."
And with that, the clams went back into the New Meadows to grow.

Full text: As a marine biologist, I always tend towards subjects that involve being under or around water. The ocean is swimming with colorful fish and animals that live on reefs and in the marine ecosystem. Based on this idea of colorful marine species, you may not think aquaculture would be a fitting topic.
But let's see if we can find some color in the idea of culturing critters like fish and oysters.
Let's begin by examining what aquaculture really is. Aquaculture, also known as fish or shellfish farming, can mean: to breed, to rear, and to harvest plants and animals in all types of water environments. This includes rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Researchers and aquaculture producers are "farming" all kinds of freshwater and marine species of fish, including shellfish (crustaceans), mollusks (oysters and clams), algae, sea vegetables, and fish eggs.
One question I get asked frequently is: What is the difference between aquaculture and mariculture? Well, it is the salinity of the water being used in the farming process.
Aquaculture uses freshwater and mariculture uses "marine" or saltwater for its medium. Some examples in the Big Bend Region are the aquaculture catfish farms in the Blountstown area, which uses fresh water and the mariculture clam farms (or leases) near Cedar Key, which uses salt water.
The aquaculture production of seafood and aquatic organisms come from fish and shellfish, produced from hatcheries, and then grown to market size in ponds, tanks, cages, or raceways. In the case of Florida clams, the clam seeds are first produced in hatcheries near Fort Pierce, then brought to Cedar Key waters, and placed on individual lease area ocean bottoms granted to area residents to raise, or "farm," these clams.
The leaseholder deposits the clam seed into four-foot square mesh bags to contain and protect the small clams. These bags are then laid out on the ocean bottom and allowed to sink into the sandy sea floor where the clams can feed on organisms naturally from the water above them. These clam leases have produced very well – creating one-inch diameter cherry stone size clams in nine months to one year. Markets have been strong and sales have been profitable.
Aquaculture also includes the production of ornamental fish for the aquarium industry. This business certainly brings out the colors I mentioned earlier. These colorful fish and plants have always attracted my wife and daughter to examine the small fish ponds at the various nursery businesses in Tallahassee.
If you are looking for a colorful display year-round at your home, this type of aquaculture can be easily set-up in small ponds in your backyard. You can have the pleasure of viewing the colorful fish and enjoy the relaxing sound of the trickling water in your small pond system.
Worldwide, aquaculture is very important in several areas, including seafood production, wild fish protection, pollution and disease control, habitat damage protection, and fish management. Fish farming has been practiced, in some parts of the world, for hundreds of years.
Today, half of the seafood eaten in the U.S. is farmed. There are some scientific projections that marine aquaculture could produce 16.5 billion tons of fish per year, or about 4,000 pounds of fish per person (Dr. Halley Froehlich, UC Santa Barbara). To help meet the growing global demand for seafood, aquaculture is a fast-growing industry. Farming fish and other seafood animals holds great promise as a solution to decreasing the pressures on our ocean resources.
The environmental impact of fish farming varies widely, depending on the species being farmed, the methods used, and where the farming is located. When good practices are used, it is possible to farm seafood in a way that has very little impact on the environment. Such operations limit habitat damage, disease, and the use of wild fish.
Environmentally aware citizens can ask this simple – but important – production question to local grocery store or restaurant owners. By asking about the farming methods of seafood you purchase, you can help shape the demand for, and ultimately the supply of, fish that's been caught or farmed in environmentally responsible ways. Consumers can play an important role in shaping our ocean's health, so start making a difference today by being an interested food production consumer.

Full text: The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee issued the following testimony by Kelly Lucas, director of the Thad Cochran Marine Aquaculture Center, at a hearing entitled "Growing the Future: Opportunities to Support Domestic Seafood Through Aquaculture":
"Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. For the record, I am Dr. Kelly Lucas - Director of the Thad Cochran Marine Aquaculture Center (TCMAC)- University of Southern Mississippi - Ocean Springs. The Center includes approximately 100,000 square feet of culture space devoted to environmentally responsible and economically feasible marine aquaculture. Our research focuses on alleviating the bottlenecks that constrain the production of marine species. We work with government and industry to address research that will advance sustainable aquaculture on land and in coastal and marine environments. Prior to my appointment at USM, I was chief scientific officer for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, the state agency with regulatory authority for managing and conserving coastal and marine resources. My testimony will provide both a science and management perspective.
"The United States imports over 90% of our seafood and half the imports are aquaculture products. We have a $14 billion-dollar seafood trade deficit. With a growing demand for seafood and static wild capture fisheries since the 1990s, aquaculture must continue to grow to meet increasing demand. While the United States has seen an increase in aquaculture production, mostly in land-based operations or in sheltered nearshore waters, we remain a minor producer. Nevertheless, we are a major supplier and exporter of equipment, feed and advanced technology. We have a choice. We can continue to source new seafood supply from abroad or we can use our expertise to develop the domestic capacity to supply our needs. There is a risk in continuing to source aquaculture products from abroad. Several of the major producer countries do not have the environmental standards we have in the United States and they do not have robust disease management regulations. Further, they tend to lack transparency which creates easy avenues for fraud and quality issues. New supply is also often from countries with political uncertainty or geopolitical instability that can threaten the supply chain and create food insecurity. Importantly, sourcing from other countries means the United States misses out on the opportunity to create jobs that generate wealth in our communities and provide safe, local, sustainable, seafood products.
Opportunities
"There is growing consensus among scientists, resource managers and industry that diversification of aquaculture to include offshore farming could expand our capacity for local, safe, seafood production. Even some environmental groups have expressed interest in the potential for aquaculture to supply a healthier protein with less impact than that from other animal sources. This is not to say that there is no opposition to aquaculture. However, public engagement and outreach on advances in aquaculture can help educate consumers and address concerns. By siting aquaculture farms away from sensitive habitats in deep waters with adequate currents the potential for pollution is reduced. Improved materials for containment and remote sensing technology has decreased the likelihood of fish escapement. Remotely controlled feeding and observation systems have helped create a mechanism for reducing over-feeding and improved feeds have reduced the reliance on forage fish.
"The economic success of sustainable commercial operations abroad and in Hawaii, Maine and New Hampshire have created a renewed optimism for offshore commercial development. Coastal communities are recognizing that aquaculture presents a sustainable business alternative. These communities have the infrastructure such as boats, processing plants, seafood markets and working waterfronts to help support operations and aquaculture can consistently supply products to keep these businesses operating. Other businesses, such a feed suppliers, equipment companies and repair shops also grow in these communities. Several offshore aquaculture operations use advanced remote sensing, unmanned systems and artificial intelligence. This sector of the blue economy would also expand to meet industry needs.
"Businesses need regulatory certainty to reduce the risk of investment. Regulatory uncertainty has been widely mentioned as a major barrier to offshore aquaculture. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Plan for Aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf Rule) published in January of 2016. The plan established a regional permitting process to manage offshore aquaculture in an environmentally sustainable manner and NOAA worked with federal permitting agencies to create a coordinated permit process. The estimated cost for engineering, siting and environmental assessment to permit a commercial structure under the Gulf rule has been estimated at $1 million dollars. However, investors expressed concerns regarding the time, actual cost and uncertainty of permit approval. Additional industry concerns of the Gulf Rule relate to permit duration, size of restricted zones around permitted areas and community acceptance. The day the Gulf Rule was announced several groups filed a lawsuit challenging NOAA's authority for permitting aquaculture under the 2007 Magnuson-Stevens Act. There is a concern that the Magnuson-Stevens Act is not the right tool to regulate aquaculture. Offshore aquaculture legislation could provide more certainty for permitting and management of aquaculture operations.
"Opportunities also exist for the growth of land-based and near-shore aquaculture. Land-based aquaculture in recirculating closed loop systems is advantageous for numerous reasons. Land-based, recirculating systems provide a controlled environment that allows year round production, increased biosecurity that reduces the occurrence and spread of disease, and the capability for reusing and recycling water to decrease the waste and increase sustainability. Because such systems are self-contained and decoupled from a water source, they can be located almost anywhere near the markets they serve where they create local jobs and supply safe, fresh, local, seafood for consumers. Near-shore aquaculture in the United States also has been increasing. Shellfish aquaculture has expanded into new geographic areas and production has increased significantly along coastal shorelines. Seaweed aquaculture has been increasing in several regions of the United States. Growth of near-shore finfish operations also has occurred in regions with nearshore water-depths sufficient to support the structures. Diversification of seafood products through systems, species and location will help build a more resilient industry and will help increase production to meet demand.
Challenges and Needs
"For the aquaculture industry to be successful on a scale necessary to meet demand, there are things that still need to be addressed. Although we have made advancements in fish feed and have reduced reliance on forage fish, we should continue to identify alternative sustainable feeds for large-scale aquaculture. Improvements in net and cage technology have decreased chances of escapes; however, we can continue to improve containment systems with new materials and remote monitoring technology. Unmanned systems and artificial intelligence can aid operators in tasks such as cleaning cages, feeding fish and detecting potential problems. This technology decreases reliance on divers and helps improve safety of operations. Continued use of these systems could further improve safety, provide for more timely and accurate assessments, and potentially decrease cost. The development of hatchery capacity and refinement of culture techniques is vital to industry development. Commercial operators need a reliable and consistent source of disease-free larval fish from documented broodstock. Whereas some larval fish species can be reliably supplied, many other species that are high value and fast-growing lack sufficient research development. Other challenges for hatcheries include a shortage of customers to purchase fish and keep the hatchery operating while waiting on domestic industry development. The use of selective breeding as a tool to increase production is far behind the plant and farm animal industries. Selective breeding of fish with higher growth rates can generally be completed in less time than breeding of farm animals. Fish convert feed to meat more efficiently than terrestrial animals and the ability to produce a steady fish supply can meet the increasing demand for protein. Fish health management is also critical to increasing aquaculture production. For some species raised in re-circulating systems or pond culture disease has been well studied and management for prevention has been important for success. Domestication of new species and offshore culture will require monitoring and adaptive health management plans to reduce disease and outbreaks.
"Supporting aquaculture development by mechanisms similar to those used to support agriculture can help industry grow. The agriculture industry grew vastly from public support of research occurring at universities, state and federal laboratories and research stations spread across the nation to bring techniques directly to farmers. Aquaculture can benefit from a similar approach of competitive peer-reviewed based research funding and extension funding to advance research and development. Advancement of aquaculture, especially selective breeding, health management and culture techniques can take multiple years for significant gains and long-term funding programs will be critical to success. Public and private partnerships also will be important to help address industry needs, promote industry growth and successfully transfer technology and techniques.
Concluding Remarks
"I appreciate the opportunity to testify before this Committee regarding aquaculture. I believe the time is now for the United States to become more self-reliant in the production of seafood. We can create jobs and reduce the seafood trade deficit while supplying safe, local, sustainable, seafood. Diversification of aquaculture production in addition to commercial fishing can help supply seafood to help meet the growing demand. Government, universities and industry working together can help create regulatory certainty, address research needs and advance sustainable aquaculture."

Full text: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Almost eight years have passed since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Join Gulf scientists as they provide updates on fisheries restoration (and their future outlook), explain the latest research on health impacts of the spill, explore how social media helps increase community resilience following disasters, describe new tools to help communities respond to future oil spills, and much more.

The 2018 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill & Ecosystem Science Conference (GoMOSES) will take place February 5-8 in New Orleans, Louisiana at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. The sixth annual conference, organized by a diverse group of partners, will bring together hundreds of experts from academia, state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, and industry to share the latest oil spill and ecosystem scientific discoveries, innovations, technologies, and policies. The conference will include 24 scientific sessions and 7 mini-sessions with 300 oral presentations and 125 poster presentations. For more information view the online program.

Scientific presentations include:


- Restoration Strategies Following Open Ocean Oil Spills: Potential for Stock Enhancement of Apex Pelagic Fish Species.
J. Stieglitz, University of Miami, Miami, FL

Since the 2010 oil spill, though there has been a large focus on the restoration of fisheries stocks in the Gulf of Mexico, little of that has been given to fish stock enhancement of larger, high value fish species such as mahi mahi and tuna. Researchers will discuss the challenges of implementing stock enhancement programs for these fish as well as new strategies made possible by advancements in aquaculture and tracking technology.



- A novel material solution to an old problem: Aerogel fabrics for oil capture and recovery
O. Karatum, Exponent Inc., Pasadena, CA

There are many methods to remove oil from the sea surface: you can burn it, break it up with aerial dispersants, or collect it with clothes attached to ship booms. Each method has it costs, benefits, and overall level of efficiency. In the wake of the spill, efforts have focused on new materials to improve the efficiency and economic feasibility of oil collection from the sea surface. Researchers will discuss their exploration of commercially available aerogels to uptake oil, including oil uptake rates, aerogel reusability, and overall oil recoverability rates.



- Measuring Social Media Use as a Source of Resilience During and After the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T. Chandler, Columbia University, New York, NY

As with other disasters around the world, individuals and communities experiencing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill used social media to share information and connect with local officials. Researchers will discuss findings from an analysis of over 500,000 Twitter records focused on how communication from the general public was conducted with policymakers, first responders, and public health organizations. Changes in the use of social media over the years following the oil spill will be examined and compared to face-to-face surveys.



- Health Risk Assessment of Exposure to Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter Emitted from Oily Seawater Treated with Dispersant
N. Afshar-Mohajer, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD

After the 2010 oil spill, there was worry over exposure of nearby communities and response workers to airborne toxic compounds from oil on the sea surface, and the application of chemical dispersants added to this concern. Little was known of the effects of surface dispersants on the emission rates of volatile compounds from oil into the air or of potential airborne toxins from the dispersants themselves. Researchers will discuss emission rates of volatile compounds into the air from crude oil, crude oil mixed with dispersants, and dispersant alone.


Other program highlights include:


- Keynote address by Dr. Geraldine Richmond, University of Oregon: "Mulling over Emulsions:  Interfacial Molecular Structure and Adsorption at Oil-Water Interfaces"

- Opening plenary panel " The Three R's of Gulf Research : Response, Restoration, and Resilience " will cover the current state of science, how GoMOSES science has contributed to our understanding of the Gulf, and remaining challenges.

- Closing plenary will feature awards for excellence in research and a panel discussion led by Laura Bowie, Executive Director of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, on the future of the conference.


The registration fee will be waived for credentialed members of the media. Please contact Leslie Smith (lsmith@oceanleadership.org) for details. Onsite registration is available.

GoMOSES is made possible by the generous support of many organizations.
